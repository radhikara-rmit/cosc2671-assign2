"Moggi: If I Was In Charge Juve Would Be Fighting For ScudettoFormer Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi has attacked the current management at his former club, saying that if he was still there the Bianconeri would be challenging for the Scudetto. He also revealed that Cristiano Ronaldo was close to joining the club a few years ago.The current management of Giovanni Cobolli Gigli, Jean-Claude Blanc and Alessio Secco has come under increased attack from Juventus supporters for the way they are running the club.  Sporting director Secco, who replaced Moggi in 2006, has been universally panned for a long-line of calamitous transfers, including spending a combined â‚¬40m on the quartet of Jean-Alain Boumsong, Tiago Mendes, Sergio Almiron and Momo Sissoko.  Moggi has blasted this transfer policy and says that had he still been in charge, he would have had Juve challenging for the title with this kind of money available.  ""If Iâ€™d have been in charge with the transfer budget that was made available last summer, Juventus would now be fighting for the Scudetto,â€￾ said Moggi.  â€œAnd Antonio Cassano would now be playing with us as well.â€￾  Moggi is still bitter with his exit following the Calciopoli crisis in 2006, and has maintained all along that the whole scandal was a conspiracy involving Massimo Moratti, Tronchetti Provera, Guido Rossi, and even possibly members of Juventusâ€™ current management who wanted the power for themselves. Finally Moggi revealed that current Manchester United superstar Cristiano Ronaldo was set to join the club before he moved to Old Trafford, but the deal fell through because Marcelo Salas rejected a transfer away.  ""Cristiano Ronaldo was already ours. He came to Turin to for a medical. It was all set, but then [Marcelo] Salas wouldnâ€™t leave,â€￾ he concluded.","Fri Feb 29, 2008 11:54 pm",9,394,World Football,Moggi:If I Was In Charge Juve Would Be Fighting For Scudetto

"Memories of a January 6-0 thrashing are a likely source of motivation and terror when Newcastle players line up against Manchester United in Saturdayâ€™s Premiership clash. Kevin Keeganâ€™s men are at a low ebb. The â€˜saviourâ€™ has yet to work his miracles. Newcastle have not won a league game since December 15 and have taken just three points from a possible 27. Along the way, Newcastle have edge nervously from mid-table safety towards the fringes of the divisionâ€™s relegation dog fight. Off the field, there are suspicions that the club might be up for sale. Backroom changes and uncertainty caused by rumoured power intrigues have conspired to make this the best and worst time for Newcastle to meet Sir Alex Fergusonâ€™s team. Victory will be greeted with a eruption of glad tidings on Tyneside. Defeat and anything approaching the hiding administered in Manchester last month and the mood of despondency will deepen. With trademark optimism, â€˜KKâ€™ believes his team is well capable of delivering a shock to the visitorsâ€™ title ambitions, and he may well take some comfort from the history books. The last time a Newcastle side managed by Keegan faced United at St James' Park, the result was a famous 5-0 victory. Keegan also toasted 3-1 and 4-1 successes over United during his time as Manchester City boss.However, Keegan accepts that his team faces a hard struggle to contain the defending champions.â€œTheyâ€™ve got the form and we havenâ€™t, so weâ€™ll see if we can surprise a few people,â€￾ Keegan said. â€œWe know what is ahead of us on Saturday.â€œTwo weeks without a game has been a long time, and the last game against Aston Villa wasnâ€™t a good performance. Weâ€™ve had a little bit of a break and we have worked the players a little bit harder.â€œI have been pleased and we are building up to what is a very big game for us.â€￾Ferguson is likely to share that conviction. United return to Premiership action knowing that a recent dip in form has seen them lose ground to Arsenal in the title race.The teamâ€™s last league outing, a 2-1 reverse at home to local rivals City, was particularly disappointing. United will be looking for a winning performance at Newcastle to cap an excellent week at home and abroad.""We are in a position where we can't afford many slip-ups now,"" Ferguson said. ""I think there will be points dropped but we have to now motor on and get a good consistency about us and hope that our immediate opponents drop points.â€œItâ€™s not easy to close these gaps. Weâ€™ve achieved it in the past, and weâ€™ve failed to do it in the past. Hopefully experience counts. You know that points will be dropped. Arsenal and Chelsea are well aware of that. The name of the game is not to drop as many points as your opponents. ""At the moment, Arsenal have an advantage. But we also know that they have some tough games to come, so they will drop points. Itâ€™s unavoidable.â€￾Ferguson too can look to the history books too for pointers to the matchâ€™s outcome. United last lost two league games on the bounce some 107 Premiership matches ago, way back in April 2005, when they were beaten by Norwich and Everton respectively. That augurs well for a three point haul from the visit to Tyneside, but Sir Alex is taking nothing for granted.He added: â€œWe have got a decent record at St Jamesâ€™ Park, but that doesnâ€™t guarantee us anything. We know we have to perform on the day. Last season we were coasting at 2-1 and they got a late goal from a deflection. You can lose a goal in any game, at any time. We have to be alert to that.â€œNewcastle is one of my favourite venues. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed going there. You see the passion of their fans, and I enjoy that. I think itâ€™s one of the main games of the season in the sense of it being a football occasion.â€￾TEAM FORM Newcastle United  February 09 vs Aston Villa (A) LOST 4-1February 03 vs Middlesbrough (H) DREW 1 â€“1January 29 vs Arsenal (A) LOST  3 â€“0January 26 vs Arsenal (A) LOST  3 â€“0January 19 vs Bolton (H) DREW  0 â€“0 Manchester United February 20 vs Lyon (A) DRAW 1 â€“ 1 (Champions League)February 18 vs Arsenal (H) WON 4 â€“ 0 (FA Cup)February 11vs Manchester City (H) LOST 1- 2February 02 vs Spurs (A) DRAW 1- 1  January 30 vs Portsmouth (H) Won 2-0 TEAM NEWS Newcastle Newcastle are set to welcome back the coveted Frenchman Charles Nâ€™Zogbia after his one game suspension. Utility man Geremi is available again after his return from the African Cup of Nations.Nigerian Obafemi Martins is struggling for fitness after spraining his ankle on international duty in Ghana but inspirational Shay Given should be able to resume duty between the sticks after a hernia injury. Otherwise, Steve Harper will deputise and make his 100th appearance for the club.Squad: Given, Harper, Forster, Beye, N'Zogbia, Enrique, Cacapa, Taylor, Faye, Edgar, Butt, Smith, Milner, Duff, Barton, LuaLua, Owen, Viduka, Ameobi, Carroll. Manchester United Sir Alex Ferguson has a full squad from which to choose apart from long term casualties Ben Foster and Mikael Silvestre. Gary Neville is still no closer to the first team duty after nearly a yearâ€™s absence. Winger Ryan Giggs has recovered from a knock suffered in Lyon, leaving Sir Alex with the dilemma of whom to leave out, particularly in midfield. Champions League goal hero Carlos Tevez seems certain to start.Squad : Van der Sar, Brown, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Ronaldo, Anderson, Scholes, Hargreaves, Giggs, Rooney, Tevez, Kuszczak, Saha, Carrick, Nani, O'Shea, Fletcher, Park, Simpson.PLAYERS TO WATCH Michael Owen (Newcastle United): The England striker needs a lift-off in an injury-ravaged season. Six goals in 21 appearances is not a bad return in a poor side but the Newcastle captain will want to show the full range of his gifts before the cameras in a high profile game. United defenders should beware his turn of speed and his alertness in the box. Despite his struggle with injuries, Owen is not yet ready for the knackersâ€™ yard.Wayne Rooney (Manchester United): Another England front man who is having a somewhat mixed season. Rooney seems to have mislaid his goals compass since returning from an autumn injury. He has scored crucial goals for United but has missed chances that a player of his stature should bury. This patchy form cannot last. Sooner or later Rooneyâ€™s eye will be in, to devastating effect. Might Saturday evening be perfect timing? PREDICTION No joy for KK against the champions. His team is in a rut, lacks pace and there are too many players treading water. How will one of the leakiest defences in the division hold at bay Manchester Unitedâ€™s multi-pronged attack? Nothing has changed fundamentally since the teams met last month. With Sir Alexâ€™s team desperate to repair the damage caused in recent weeks to its defence of the title, keeping the scoreline respectable seems to be Newcastleâ€™s only hope. Newcastle 0 - 3 United","Sun Feb 24, 2008 3:46 am",27,988,World Football,Newcastle united v manchester united

"Ancelotti: Gattuso & Kaka Back For Arsenal, Ronaldo MaybeMilan have been handed a huge boost by the news that Gennaro Gattuso and Kaka will be fit to play against Arsenal next week, however there are still doubts over Alexandre Pato, even if Ronaldo could make the game.LivornoThe Rossoneri have the chance to move into fourth place in Serie A if they can win their rescheduled week 16 game against Livorno at San Siro tomorrow night. Speaking at the pre-match press conference Ancelotti has spoken about the current injury situation at the club. â€œThere will be no Pato or Kaka [against Livorno]. Gattuso will return, just like Gilardino following his suspension last Sunday,â€￾ said Ancelotti. â€œFor the rest, we must evaluate those who played on Sunday. Probably Nesta will not play, because he has not yet recovered from the back problems, and even Maldini, who I must rest for one round. â€œPirlo and Ambrosini are fine, they have recovered and will be available.â€￾ Gattuso & Kaka Back For ArsenalThere were huge worries that Milan would travel to London to play Arsenal next week with numerous first-team players out. Gattuso was at first expected to be sidelined for four-to-six weeks but the midfield bulldog has once again proved what a quick healer he is. Kaka meanwhile will also make it following some knee problems. â€œGattuso is fine, he has recovered very quickly, also thanks to the great application that he had during treatment. He is a great professional,â€￾ Ancelotti explained. â€œPato is a bit behind Kaka. Ricky will be available against Parma [at the weekend].â€￾ RonaldoAncelotti also spoke about the current injury woes for Ronaldo, but has some positive news. ""Ronaldo? Itâ€™s a condition not a physical problem. There is the possibility of making him work well this week and propose him against Parma,â€￾ the Coach stated. PaloschiFinally Ancelotti said that Sundayâ€™s goal-hero Alberto Paloschi will play against Livorno if Filippo Inzaghi is not passed fit for the match. â€œIf Inzaghi has difficulty in his recovery, Paloschi will play from the start. Otherwise he will start from the bench and Inzaghi will play,â€￾ concluded Carletto.","Wed Feb 13, 2008 8:17 pm",0,111,World Football,Ancelotti

"Kaka Could Be Out For Four Months With Knee ProblemMilan superstar Kaka may be forced to sit out of action for four months in order to cure a chronic knee problem, according to the Corriere dello Sport.The European and World Footballer of the Year has been playing with a niggling sensation in his knee for quite some time now, but the problem has worsened in recent weeks.This has been a factor in Kakaâ€™s under-par performances of late, and the pain was said to be so bad in Sunday nightâ€™s 1-0 win over Fiorentina that the player was forced to come off in the closing stages.The 25-year-old has pulled out of Brazilâ€™s international squad and has been replaced by Werder Bremenâ€™s Diego.Kaka is now a doubt for this Sundayâ€™s game with Siena, possibly leaving Milan without a forward of any description, as Alberto Gilardino is suspended and Alexandre Pato, Ronaldo and Filippo Inzaghi injured.In order to clear up the injury, Kaka may be forced to sit out of action for four months, which would surely be an irreparable blow to Milan.Rossoneri doctor Pierre Meersseman is less concerned about the problem however, and does not believe that a spell on the sidelines is required.""This is nothing serious,â€￾ he told Milan Channel.â€œFor a couple of years he has been living with this discomfort in his knee. â€œBefore and after training and matches, KakÃ  undergoes physiotherapy exercises that make it better. Even if he has four to five months rest, there is no guarantee the problem will pass.â€￾","Tue Feb 05, 2008 11:39 pm",5,552,World Football,Kaka Could Be Out For Four Months With Knee Problem

"Serie A Preview: Reggina - MilanWhat: Italian Serie AWho: Reggina Calcio (18pts., 17th) vs. AC Milan (27 pts., 7th)When: Wednesday January 30, 20:30 (CET)Where: Stadio Orneste Granillo, Reggio Calabria Sink or Swim Reggina are currently treading the dangerous waters of the relegation zone, with only one point separating them from the drop. However, with this match being a makeup fixture, it gives the Amaranto an opportunity to put some distance between themselves and the bottom three sides.  Reggina have yet to lose in the league this year, having drawn twice and been the victors once. But with their upcoming schedule full of the top sides (Milan here, then Roma, Udinese, Juventus and Lazio consecutively in February), they will be lucky to continue getting such results. The Amaranto average less than one goal scored per match this season. Fortunately, this match takes place at home, as they are winless on their travels. Thatâ€™s not to say they have a great record at home, however. In nine matches played on their home turf, they have a record of three wins, three draws, and three losses. Their attack has lackluster nearly all season long, and their leading scorer, Nicola Amoruso (with five goals to his name), is out of this match against Milan with a fractured rib injury. Not only has the offense struggled, but the defense has given up three or more goals on no less than four occasions. Only in two of those matches were the goals surrendered to a top-half side.  Defensive frailty such as this is surely not the benchmark of a club that will be challenging for honors, let alone remain in the top flight. More well-rounded performances are required from Reggina if they are to stay in Serie A for another season.  Full Speed Ahead For Milan, the task is simple, not only in this match, but for the remainder of the season. Yet several roadblocks, possibly of their own doing, could get in the way.  With ten points separating Milan from fourth place (currently occupied by Fiorentina), which is the final Champions League qualification spot, they realistically need to win this match and most of the remaining fixtures this season. However, in their past two matches, they have squandered a multitude of scoring chances. This did not hurt them in the end with their 2-0 victory over Genoa on Sunday, but it was one of the main culprits in the 2-1 to Atalanta last Wednesday. In particular, Alexandre Pato has missed several golden opportunities to score when alone with the â€˜keeper since he made his debut in the first match of the year; although, itâ€™s not all Patoâ€™s fault. The defense was horrid in the loss to Atalanta, with both goals being scored on the counterattack partially because of defensive errors. The central defensive partnership of Alessandro Nesta and Kakha Kaladze has been mostly good, but each of these players is prone to temporary lapses in judgment. Here in this match, Milan will be facing a side at the bottom of the standings, and they must get a victory. Also, looking at the schedule they face for the rest of the season, it does not appear as though they will have many occasions where they have to face top sides week in, week out. Therefore, one would think that Milan will do just as they have before (most recently last term), and climb back into the top positions in the standings by seasonâ€™s end.  FORM GUIDE (last five fixtures)  Reggina12/23  Reggina 3-1 Catania Serie A1/12 Empoli 1-1 Reggina Serie A1/17 Inter 3-0 Reggina  Coppa Italia1/20 Reggina 2-0 Cagliari Serie A1/27 Atalanta 2-2 Reggina  Serie AMilan1/13 Milan 5-2 Napoli  Serie A1/16 Catania 1-1 Milan Coppa Italia1/20 Udinese 0-1 Milan Serie A1/23 Atalanta 2-1 Milan Serie A1/27 Milan 2-0 Genoa  Serie ATEAM NEWS In this match, Reggina will not have the services of Nicola Amoruso, who is recovering from a fractured rib, and Carlos Valdez is suspended. However, Francesco Cozza returns from suspension.  For Milan, there are again numerous players missing. Dida, Jankulovski and Serginho are long-term absentees, while Paolo Maldini will likely be rested after going the entire ninety minutes on Sunday. The big news on the injury front for Milan is that Ronaldo is once again sidelined, after a muscular strain was picked up recently. This puts in doubt the future of Ronaldo remaining a Rossonero, as his contract is up in the summer.  PLAYERS TO WATCH Edgar Barreto (Reggina) â€“ He was terrific in the weekend draw away to Atalanta, setting up Luca Vigiani for the first goal and scoring the second himself. The young Paraguayan will be eager to build upon his recent form. Alexandre Pato (Milan) â€“ This young Brazilian striker played very well in the 2-0 victory at home against Genoa on Sunday, scoring both goals. His form is steadily improving, and his speed will push the Reggina defense to the limit.  POSSIBLE STARTING XIâ€™s Reggina (4-4-2): Campagnolo; Modesto, Lanzaro, Aronico, Cirillo; Barreto, Cozza, Vigiani, Missiroli; Brienza, Ceravolo Milan (4-3-2-1): Kalac; Oddo, Nesta, Kaladze, Favalli; Gattuso, Pirlo, Brocchi; KakÃ , Seedorf; Pato  PREDICTION Reggina are not a side that is known for being giant killers. While Milan have not been as good as advertised this season, they certainly qualify for the â€œsleeping giantsâ€￾ tag. The Rossoneri wonâ€™t need to play their best in this match, but will do enough to get the three points. Reggina 1-2 Milan","Wed Jan 30, 2008 8:24 pm",0,81,World Football,Serie A Preview

"Madrid Will Never Give Up On RonaldoReal Madrid sporting director Predrag Mijatovic has stated that the club will never give up on trying to sign Cristiano RonaldoThe Portuguese winger has established himself as one of the best players in the world over the last two years and only looks like going from strength to strength.There have been reports emanating from Spain that the Spanish champions could offer a world record-breaking Â£50 million in an attempt to secure his services.For a club with the financial strength of Manchester United, such money, though obviously valuable, is of no necessity. It is highly unlikely the player would be coaxed away for any fee unless it was he who decided to leave.Though he has on several occasions expressed his desire to play in Spain 'someday', he very much appears dedicated to English champions Manchester United for the moment.Pedja Mijatovic is realistic regarding Ronaldo's situation, but The Sun reports that Real Madrid will always be on standby, waiting for the star man to become in any way available.â€œRonaldo is an exceptional footballer and, although we know signing a player like that is very complicated, we will just have to keep working on it,"" he said.â€œIf one day a chance opens up, then we will be there trying to sign him. Heâ€™d grace any team in the world.â€￾ Ronaldo has scored an astonishing 22 goals in 25 appearances so far this season.","Thu Jan 17, 2008 2:33 pm",27,1880,World Football,Madrid Will Never Give Up On Ronaldo
"Gilardino To Leave Milan?Alberto Gilardino could leave Milan at the end of the season, his agent has hinted.The 25-year-old has never found his feet at San Siro following his big money move from Parma in 2005, and he has particularly struggled this season. The striker was set to start alongside debutant Alexandre Pato in last Sundayâ€™s match with Napoli.According to the Corriere dello Sport, Gilardino was said to be furious when Coach Carlo Ancelotti then opted to field the half-fit Ronaldo instead of him.El Fenomeno scored twice as the Ka-Pa-Ro trident, with Kaka attacking from deep, dazzled in a 5-2 victory.Ancelotti tried to explain his decision as a â€œtechnical choiceâ€￾, and stated publicly that Gilardino still has a role to play at the club.However the 2006 World Cup winner feels as though the club and management have no confidence in him.â€œAlberto will certainly remain at Milan until the end of the season, then we will see,â€￾ the playerâ€™s agent Marcello Bonetto said.One team who would be very interested in signing Gilardino is Fiorentina. Viola Coach Cesare Prandelli is a huge fan of the striker after working with him successfully at Parma.However Gilardinoâ€™s wages could prove a sticking point as his â‚¬3.5m a year earnings is above the Fiorentina salary cap.","Thu Jan 17, 2008 1:45 am",0,82,World Football,Gilardino To Leave Milan?

In fact, my rapport with the Giallorossi is one of honesty and friendship.â€œThe only problem is that so far we have not been able to reach an agreement over my contract extension, but these are things that happen. We will talk about it again in future and I hope to strike a deal because I want to remain with Roma.â€￾This is not the first time that Mancini has had to pledge his future to the side, as a section of the fans turned on him after reports of negotiations with hated rivals Juventus last year.â€œRome is a city where I and my family are very happy and we want to stay, but in football everyone knows that problems can occur when a contract approaches its expiry. This is because both the club and the player try to defend their own interests.â€￾There had also been newspaper talk of a row that saw him not talk to captain Francesco Totti for a year and Mancini has been visibly irritated when replaced during games this term.â€œI am happy with the whole squad and have not had problems with anyone in the locker room, let alone the Coach, who I have great respect for.â€œOf course I am disappointed when I get substituted, because Iâ€™d love to stay on the field and help my teammates, but I respect the decisions of the tactician without rancour or anger.

Here they want to win immediately and there is no time to wait around for a youngster to prove himself, so clubs go straight to champions of experience who are considered reliable. Itâ€™s a different approach overseas,â€￾ said the former Premier League player.â€œI am sure that if Cesc Fabregas, Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo were in Serie A, theyâ€™d play regularly as well, although they certainly would not have been given their debuts in these big clubs at 17.

Sebastian Giovinco, Claudio Marchisio and Luca Cigarini will have a great future, while Alberto Aquilani and Riccardo Montolivo have already grown up and found their place.â€￾Casiraghi has some ideas on why the clubs in Italy are more reticent to put their faith in younger talents.â€œIt is the system that does not allow you to run a risk. When you are obliged to win, second place in the table is considered failure and a Coach can feel the axe over his head from Week 1, you tend to rely on an experienced player rather than a talented youngster who needs more time to mature.â€œOur youth systems are among the best in the world.

But this is my dream.""Real Madrid and Barcelona have both been interested in him, and a fresh report earlier this month suggested that the Catalan club would make a big money move should Ronaldinho leave.â€œItâ€™s a fantastic league where they play beautiful football,"" he continued, reiterating his craving for Spain. ""However, I am convinced the English league is the most competitive in every aspect,"" he added quickly. â€œI feel very comfortable in the English league.""I think itâ€™s beautiful, and if I stay in Manchester that would be great for me - I love the club; I love the supporters, and it would be amazing for me to stay there for many years.â€œBut maybe one day, only God knows whether it will happen, I would like to play for a Spanish team and experience the difference.â€￾Manchester United have made it abundantly clear that they have no intention of selling their biggest star, but the rumours continue to persist. These comments will only fan the fires.Many pundits believe that he will be able to showcase his real potential only in the realms of Spain's very latin football, so to speak, and the player himself seems to believe in it.There is a more shrewd view, of course.

"CWC Semi-Final Preview: AC Milan - Urawa RedsWhat: Club World Cup, Semi-finalWho: AC Milan (Italy, Europe) Urawa Reds, (Japan, Asia)When: 11:30 CET - Thursday December 13, 2007Where: International Stadium, Yokohama, Japan The champions of Europe and Asia meet on Thursday evening to decide which continent will be represented in the final of the Club World Cup on Sunday. Milan Aiming To End Negative Sequence Milan come into this edition of the FIFA Club World Cup having failed in their previous three attempts to become club champions of the world. Four years ago, whilst the tournament was still known as the Intercontinental Cup they lost on penalties to Boca Juniors following a 1-1 draw after extra time. The Argentine-giants and 2007 Copa Libertadores winners are the Rossoneriâ€™s most likely opponents in Sundayâ€™s final if, as expected, Milan beat Japanese-outfit Urawa Reds in Thursdayâ€™s semi-final. Before this defeat to Boca Juniors, Milan also suffered losses in 1993 and 1994. In the former they were beaten 3-2 by an outstanding Sao Paulo side containing the likes of Cerezo, Leonardo and Luiz Muller, while a year later they were defeated 2-0 by Jose Chilavertâ€™s Velez Sarsfield. Urawa's Chance For More Glory After Roller-Coaster YearThis is the game that the whole of Japan have been waiting for and while Urawa may not always be everyoneâ€™s favourite team in the Land of the Rising Sun, it is not only their famous fans that will be cheering them on tonight. Urawa are the first Japanese club to appear at the competition. This year, FIFA decided to give Japan, the host nation, a place but Urawa qualified in their own right by lifting the Asian Champions League trophy. It has been an amazing 12 months for the Saitama side. The Reds won the J-League for the first time last December, won the continental cup at their first attempt and are looking to round things off with the Club World Cup. Despite a glorious year, Urawa entered the competition on the back of a terrible run of domestic form. Exhausted by their Asian exertions, Urawa collected a mere three points from their last five leagues allowing Kashima Antlers to overturn a massive 10-point deficit and claim the title by a margin of two points. An Emperorâ€™s Cup exit at the hands of second division Ehime FC was another setback. After the frantic last two months of the season, Urawa finally had time to recover before comfortably defeating Sepahan of Iran in Monday's quarter-final. Previous Successes  Milan first appeared in the final in the competitionâ€™s very original two-legged format back in 1963. Nereo Roccoâ€™s men were involved in a legendary match with Peleâ€™s Santos, which finished 6-6 on aggregate, and was settled by a 1-0 playoff win for the Brazilians. The Rossoneri then won their next three outings, beating the infamously violent Independiente in 1969, Atletico Nacional 20 years later, and finally Olimpia Asuncion in 1990. All in all Milan have a record of won three and lost four in previous â€˜Club World Cupâ€™ appearances.  European Jinx  Since the FIFA Club World Cup officially replaced the Intercontinental Cup in 2005, a European team has yet to win. Liverpool lost 1-0 to Sao Paulo in 2005, while Barcelona lost by the same scoreline to Internacional last year. Milan Vice-President Adriano Galliani has declared the FIFA Club World Cup as Milanâ€™s â€œnumber one objectiveâ€￾ for the season so surely Milan will break this European hoodoo? Asian teams have yet to set the competition alight. Saudi Arabiaâ€™s Al-Ittihad defeated African champions Al-Ahly in 2005 before losing 3-2 to eventual winners Sao Paulo in the semi-final. South Koreaâ€™s Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors eased past Auckland City in 2006 before losing 1-0 to Club America in the quarter-final. FORM GUIDE Milan Milan â€“ Celtic 1-0 (Champions League) Milan â€“ Juventus 0-0 Benfica â€“ Milan 1-1 Cagliari â€“ Milan 1-2 Shakhtar Donetsk â€“ Milan 0-3 (Champions League)Milan â€“ Torino 0-0 Urawa Urawa â€“ Sepahan 3-1 (CWC) Yokohama FC â€“ Urawa 1-0 Ehime â€“ Urawa 1-0 (Emperorâ€™s Cup)Urawa â€“ Kashima 0-1 Kawasaki â€“ Urawa 1-1 TEAM NEWS Milan Milan have been boosted by the return to training of Ronaldo and Marek Jankulovski. While the latter could be set to play, â€˜El Fenomenoâ€™ will not be risked, although it is speculated that he will be fit for Sundayâ€™s final should the Rossoneri make it there. Reports coming out of Italy suggest that Coach Carlo Ancelotti will field a strong line-up and will not fall into the trap that many European teams have done in this competition in the past in under-estimating their opposition. Urawa The ligament injury suffered by Brazilian playmaker Robson Ponte in the final game of the season is a big blow to boss Holger Osieck. Captain Nobuhisa Yamada and striker Tatsuya Tanaka are also doubts. PLAYERS TO WATCH Kaka (Milan) The newly-crowned Ballon dâ€™Or winner was mobbed by theatrical fans when Milan landed at Tokyo International Airport last week. The brilliant Brazilian should have too much class for the Japanese-side to handle. Marcos Tulio Tanaka (Urawa) The Brazilian-born defender is a giant at the back for Urawa and was named J-League MVP in 2006. Tanaka is strong in the tackle, good on the ball and great in the air. He is a threat from set pieces but against a star-studded Milan, his defensive qualities are what the Reds need. PREDICTION Providing Milan go into this game in a professional manner there can surely be only one winner. It wonâ€™t be easy as some think howeverâ€“ backed by some of the most passionate fans in the world, Urawa were unbeaten in the Asian Champions League and are fired up.

"Milan star Ronaldo has spoken about the infamous Juventus-Inter title decider from 1998, and has praised the Bianconeri for cleaning themselves upThis Sunday El Fenomeno faces Juventus for the first time in Serie A since his days at Inter Milan. During his spell at the Nerazzurri there was the notorious â€˜Ronaldo incidentâ€™ from the 1997/98 season. With just four games remaining of the season, just one point separated the top-two Juventus and Inter, as they met at the Stadio Delle Alpi.  The Bianconeri were 1-0 up in the second-half, when Ronaldo was blatantly fouled by Mark Iuliano in the penalty area. The referee incredibly waved play-on, and indeed awarded a spot-kick down the other end just seconds later. Alessandro Del Piero missed it, but the Turin-giants held on to virtually guarantee themselves the Scudetto.  â€œIt is a different Juventus compared to the one I knew, completely new and also clean,â€￾ Ronaldo told La Stampa.  â€œThat game [in 1998] does anger me because it was obvious the desire of the referee was to make Juventus win.  â€œThe truth however came out in the end but it is better to always forget about the past.

"CL Preview: Shakhtar Donetsk - MilanWhat: UEFA Champions League-Group DWho: Shakhtar Donetsk (6 pts., 2nd) vs. AC Milan (6 pts., 1st)When: Tuesday November 6, 20:45 (CET)Where: RSC Olympiyskiy Stadium, Donetsk, Ukraine Setting aside the match which these clubs contested two weeks ago, Shakhtar and Milan actually have encounters from the recent past to draw on for a little bit of insight for this match.  Looking back to their previous encounters from the group stage of the 2004/05 edition of the Champions League, Shakhtar will be eager to improve upon what occurred in their first ever meetings with Milan. In September 2004, the Ukraine club opened their European campaign with an inauspicious start in the 1-0 defeat at home to Milan. They had chances during the match, but struggled to put together any real cohesive play, and were on course to finish the match with a disappointing scoreless draw. However, things then went from bad to worse, as Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorf scored the lone goal of the game with a strike in the 83rd minute to steal the points for Milan.  The return fixture in Milan was not quite as respectable (even though the first match was hardly so), with the Rossoneri dominating the visitors with a 4-0 win, thanks to braces by KakÃ  and the now-departed Hernan Crespo.  Despite Shakhtarâ€™s changeover in the squad, several of the players from those two matches remain for them, and will fight in earnest not to have a repeat of the occurrences from three seasons ago.  Domestic Domination Not only have Shakhtar done well so far in this seasonâ€™s Champions League (with two wins from three matches), but they are ahead of usual Ukrainian powerhouse Dynamo Kyiv by ten points in the Ukraine Premier League after fifteen rounds of fixtures. This has created an atmosphere of complacency and lack of focus, at least temporarily, as evidenced by the words of manager Mircea Lucescu following the 1-0 away victory over Metalurh Donetsk on Saturday: â€œI am happy with the result. I liked how my players reacted to Ilsinho's dismissal - rather than breaking them, it made them improve a lot. We played better with ten men than with a full squad. It was hard for the lads to find their game because they were thinking about Milan and did not exert themselves, hoping a goal would come automatically.â€￾  They can feel confident coming into this match against Milan, but Lucescu will be sure to keep his players grounded ahead of this crunch fixture which will determine first place in the group.  The Saviorâ€™s Returnâ€¦And Just in Time While Shakhtar Donetsk have begun well both in Europe and at home this season, Milan have not done quite as well as they had hoped in either arena. A ninth-place standing in Serie A after eleven matches is surely not what Milan were aiming for this season, as a return to prominence in Italy was expected to be on the cards. Already sitting eleven points adrift of leaders Inter, they will now just focus on securing a top-four spot.  Milan are also not playing their best in the Champions League, which is always their main aim, anyway. They began the competition with a 2-1 home win over Benfica, but gave up a late goal which placed the result in doubt for the final minutes. This was followed by a lackluster 2-1 loss away to Celtic, in which they lost net minder Dida to a one-match suspension for his poor display of sportsmanship by feigning injury after a fan invaded the pitch and made minimal contact with his neck.  Things are looking up, though. Just as Ronaldoâ€™s arrival last January was viewed as a saving grace for their domestic campaign, so too is the case this season, but now in both competitions. Despite Alberto Gilardino scoring twice in the match against Shakhtar two weeks ago, the club and supporters lack confidence in his abilities, and whenever Ronaldo is ready to play, he will be preferred to Gilardino.  But what of Ronaldoâ€™s return, a saga which has been in the papers since the summer. After sustaining yet another injury (this time a thigh problem) in a career which has been blighted by nearly every ailment, Ronaldo sought outside help, rather than entrust his health to the Milan medical staff. Apparently, his injury had been misdiagnosed by the Milan staff, thus furthering his time off the pitch. Now though, he appears to be fully fit again, and has come out in the press recently to state his thoughts not only on his return to the squad, but also his intentions, saying: â€œIâ€™m so happy to be back in the squad and to be a player again. I have always reacted well to pressure and I know what I am capable of and what I have to offer Milan. Of course it hasnâ€™t been the best start to the season, but this is my beginning. I have been doing well in training and I think Iâ€™m ready to go. Now I just want to get on the pitch and score.â€￾  This is precisely what is going to be expected of him, so it is good he feels he can make an instant contribution. Filippo Inzaghi has not scored a league goal this season, and Alberto Gilardino is jeered by the supporters every time he plays.

They will attack Milan and try to control the pace of the game, now back in their home stadium after having played their last two European fixtures on the road.  Milan get back the services of goalkeeper Dida, who returns from his one-match suspension for the events which took place in Glasgow. Paolo Maldini returns to the squad, after being rested over the weekend, while Massimo Oddo also comes back into the fold from his injured spell. Emerson and Marek Jankulovski are not fit and have been left out of the squad. The biggest news for this Milan team is that Ronaldo has been included in the squad, and could see action, but probably as a substitute. PLAYERS TO WATCH Cristiano Lucarelli (Shakhtar) â€“ After scoring against Milan last time around, but having his goal mean nothing in the end, he will be ready to make his efforts count this time. Ronaldo (Milan) â€“ He will need to back up his claims made ahead of this match that he is ready to â€œget on the pitch and scoreâ€￾ by actually putting the ball in the net.

"Decision after decision is going against Juventus this season, including the award of two absolutely non-existent penalties for Napoli on Saturday. Carlo Garganese asks if there is a post-Calciopoli conspiracy against La Vecchia Signoraâ€¦Calcio Debate: Is There A Conspiracy Against Juventus?zoom - galleriaFor many years Juventus were often seen as the club who controlled the status quo in the Italian football world. Much of this perception was often clouded by the jealousy and hatred that comes with being, domestically, the most successful ever Italian team. However it must be noted that in the past there have been quite a number of high-profile refereeing â€˜mistakesâ€™ that the Bianconeri have benefited from. I will outline possibly the three most controversial of these. The first was during the 1980/81 season when Juventus and Roma faced off in a crucial title-decider in Turin. The home side went into the game one point clear of their opponents at the top of the table. With the scores at 0-0, Roma sweeper Maurizio Turrone thought he had scored the winner with a header, however the referee then disallowed the goal for a contentious offside decision. The match finished 0-0, Juve won their next two games and claimed the Scudetto. The second controversy took place just a season later. Both Juventus and Fiorentina went into the final day of the campaign level on points at the top. The Viola could only manage a goalless draw at Cagliari after having a seemingly perfectly good goal disallowed, while Juve were awarded a debatable penalty at Catanzaro, which Liam Brady converted to give them a 1-0 victory, and thus the Championship. Finally, there was the â€˜Ronaldo incidentâ€™ from 1997/98. With just four games remaining of the season, just one point separated the top-two Juventus and Inter, as they met at the Stadio Delle Alpi. The Bianconeri were 1-0 up in the second-half, when Ronaldo was blatantly fouled by Mark Iuliano in the penalty area. The referee incredibly waved play-on, and indeed awarded a spot-kick down the other end just seconds later. Alessandro Del Piero missed it, but the Turin-giants held on to virtually guarantee another Scudetto success. So for many years, accusations rang round that Juventus had the referees in their pocket and that this was the reason why the club was so successful. Their reputation was not helped by the decision in the 1990s to hire Luciano Moggi as their general manager. Moggi was well-known for his powerful influence in the game during his time at Napoli and Torino. In fact whilst with the Granata, â€˜Lucky Lucianoâ€™ had infamously spent thousands of pounds in hiring prostitutes for referees during the 1991/92 UEFA Cup campaign. Torino made it all the way to the final, where they were â€˜unluckyâ€™ to lose on away goals to Ajax. The penalties issued out in the aftermath of the Calciopoli crisis in 2006 was intended to clean up all the corruption that had supposedly permeated the Italian game for decades. Juventus of course suffered the most and were revoked of two Scudetti and demoted to Serie B. However, on the evidence of the events that have taken place this season, the corruption in the game is still well and truly present. The only difference is that now it is being directed against the Bianconeri. The huge number of refereeing â€˜mistakesâ€™ against the Old Lady this campaign cannot be a coincidence, and the events on Saturday night at Napoli just took things to another plane. With the scores level at 1-1, Mauro Bergonzi awarded two absolutely scandalous penalties to the home side. The first in particular cannot possibly have come about as a result of human error. Giorgio Chiellini clearly won the ball from Ezequiel Lavezzi - in fact he did not even go to ground â€“ so how Mr Bergonzi could come to such a conclusion I do not know. Juventus have already conceded five penalties this season and all but one of them was hugely debatable. Indeed against Cagliari, Claudio Ranieriâ€™s men had three spot-kickâ€™s awarded against them, one of which was only retracted after Chiellini had threatened to have a human fit on the field if the ref did not change his mind. Then of course there is the Udinese game in week seven when Antonio Nocerino was denied a clear penalty, and Vincenzo Iaquinta had a goal mysteriously disallowed. Seven days later against Roma, Francesco Totti was also offside when he scored the first of his two goals. When you add up all these incidents, you can understand why many believe there is a post-Calciopoli conspiracy against Juventus. Although it must be noted that Iaquintaâ€™s goal against Fiorentina in week seven should not have stood, this is just a drop in the ocean compared to everything else that has taken place. â€œWhen these things happen, it is quite simply a scandal,â€￾ blasted David Trezeguet on Saturday. â€œWe cannot be treated this way,â€￾ cried President Giovanni Cobolli Gigli. â€œI have never seen anything like it in my life.â€￾ It is abundantly clear that Juventus are being deliberately punished upon their return to Serie A. At the very least, as Claudio Ranieri said today, â€œthe 50/50 decisions are going against the teamâ€￾.However the less naÃ¯ve among us will surely see that there is something more sinister in it than that. Italian football has sadly failed to remove corruption from its game.

"Roma captain Francesco Totti calls for his side to deliver a crushing revenge on Manchester United and hints that he may return to the Azzurri set-up.The Giallorossi return to the scene of last seasonâ€™s 7-1 evisceration at the last 16 stage of the Champions League when they travel to Old Trafford tomorrow.Much of the pre-match talk has inevitably centred around the capital clubâ€™s desire for revenge and Totti is refusing to play that down.â€œIâ€™d love to beat them 7-0,â€￾ he told La Gazzetta dello Sport. â€œThe Champions League is the only title that I havenâ€™t won and I dream of doing so even though I know it is difficult to do it with Roma.â€œI think that Barcelona are the favourites as they have Ronaldinho, Lionel Messi, Thierry Henry and Samuel Etoâ€™o all together.â€œThe Scudetto? We shouldnâ€™t pretend that we arenâ€™t amongst the favourites, but we shouldnâ€™t raise expectations too high as the Roman people quickly go from euphoria to depression.â€œInter are the squad to beat as it is hard to believe in Milan, but while we lost Cristian Chivu we have Juan, Cicinho and Ludovic Giuly and will be up there.â€￾As for his own personal goals, it seems that Er Pupone has lost none of his drive and ambition.â€œI have a great chance of retaining the Capocannoniere title as other great strikers like Luca Toni, Cristiano Lucarelli and Rolando Bianchi are all gone,â€￾ he insisted.â€œIâ€™ll do everything to keep hold of the Golden Boot, but I think David Trezeguet will be tough to beat and Toni is scoring lots. ""I should also be a candidate for the Golden Ball alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka and Ruud Van Nistelrooy.â€￾After a long period of speculation, Totti retired from international football this summer, but he hinted that his Azzurri adventure may not yet be over.â€œItâ€™s very difficult to say whether thereâ€™s a chance I could return,â€￾ he admitted.â€œIt was never said that I would never return and obviously I would like to play at the World Cup in South Africa, but so much would have to change.â€￾Roma squad: Bertagnoli, Curci, Doni; Antunes, Cicinho, Ferrari, Juan, Mexes, Tonetto; Aquilani, Barusso, Brighi, De Rossi, Perrotta, Pit, Pizarro; Esposito, Giuly, Mancini, Totti, Vucinic","Tue Oct 02, 2007 1:08 pm",28,1894,World Football,Totti

"Inter patron Massimo Moratti has confessed he wanted to hire Fabio Capello in place of Roberto Mancini last year.It is a shock revelation, especially considering at the time he was in charge of hated rivals Juventus and Mancio had just finished third in Serie A â€“ the campaign later revolutionised by Calciopoli.â€œIt is true, last year I had given Capello some real thought,â€￾ Moratti told magazine â€˜Famiglia Cristiana.â€™â€œBut then my faith in Mancini prevailed and it was a decision that thoroughly paid off.â€￾The tactician went on to win the Scudetto in a record-breaking run and the Italian Super Cup, but the pressure is back on Mancio to repeat himself.â€œThe Scudetto race is obligatory, the Champions League is a duty. I am not aiming for another Serie A title just to stop people saying the last one was â€˜damagedâ€™, because this is only thought by those who were out of the running for very serious reasons or didnâ€™t have a good enough squad to compete with us.â€￾The Calciopoli penalties inevitably smoothed the path for the Nerazzurri, but this time around they must face off with a renovated Juventus and teams starting the season on an even playing field.Moratti is a lifelong Inter fan and his father before him was the President of their most successful side â€“ so who does he consider to be their best XI?â€œZlatan Ibrahimovic, the Ronaldo of his first season here, Luis Suarez, Mariolino Corso, the entire defence of the Grande Inter plus Javier Zanetti. Iâ€™d say Antonio Valentin Angelillo, Lennart Skoglund, Benito Lorenzi and then Giuliano Sarti in goal.

"Ancelotti: We deserved no more Carlo Ancelotti admits Milan did not deserve any more than a draw at Siena, even if the goal they conceded was offside.â€œWe started the match very well and had two excellent scoring opportunities, then our tempo dropped and we ran into some problems against an organised defence,â€￾ he noted of the 1-1 result.Alessandro Nestaâ€™s volley gave the Rossoneri a point in stoppages, but Clarence Seedorf almost earned a victory in the final seconds when his free kick cannoned off the underside of the crossbar.â€œSeedorfâ€™s goal at the end would have been an excessive prize for us, because Milan did not have a good game. It was poor, but we did not have long to prepare for this tie because of the number of players away on international duty.â€￾Ancelotti left Kaka, Massimo Oddo, Andrea Pirlo and the injured Ronaldo behind for this trip and also rested Pippo Inzaghi and Marek Jankulovski for the first half.â€œThis situation will often happen to us this season and we are going to have to get used to it. We know the internationals have to leave and must do better in future.â€￾Siena had taken the lead through a comical Massimo Maccarone goal, as Nelson Dida spilled a harmless Cristian Bucchi shot and Kakha Kaladze tripped up on the clearance.â€œDida made a fairly obvious mistake, much like the linesman who did not flag Maccarone offside,â€￾ added Ancelotti. â€œIt was a series of errors.â€￾Yet Siena Coach Andrea Mandorlini was also angry with the referee after Mario Frickâ€™s straight red card for a tackle from behind on Seedorf.â€œThere are regrets over the result, although this was yet another good performance,â€￾ said the tactician who has never won a Serie A match in his career.â€œWe are also disappointed with the dismissal, but our real campaign kicks off now.â€￾","Sun Sep 16, 2007 11:00 am",3,178,World Football,Siena V Milan

"A four-part FourFourTwo investigation into youth development starts in Brazil, where the nationâ€™s cream is evaluated via a set of annual trials with a cast of thousands.Dawn in Rio de Janeiro. The traffic that clogs the cityâ€™s wide thoroughfare, Avenida das Americas, each morning has not yet built up. Only the white VW coaches carrying poor domestic servants from the favelas in the north to their employers in the south can be seen chugging along. Otherwise this roaring city of over a million inhabitants is quiet. Itâ€™s 6.55am when 19 freshly-groomed teenagers clamber onto a rented bus that will take them out into the Brazilian countryside. Some speak quietly to each other, but most sit nervously in silence. â€œThe first time is horrible. Youâ€™re tense. Youâ€™re not yourself. It never works. This is my fifth time. I know what itâ€™s like.â€￾ Paulo Sergio da Souza is a pimply 16-year-old who has played with Flamengoâ€™s youth team since he was 10. Yet every year, he is forced to endure what has become a nail-biting tradition for every ambitious Brazilian football player. It does not matter how well Paulo Sergio played last year. If he does not perform at this yearâ€™s peneira he will be forced to leave the club.â€œCafu went through 14 different peneiras before he got a spot,â€￾ he notes. â€œAnd look where he is today. You have to be stubborn.â€￾The bus stops, but only so that more boys can jump aboard. One of the players falls asleep, his head nodding up and down in rhythm with the busâ€™s bumps. Some stare into space, others listen to their iPods. These are Brazilâ€™s best-paid teenagers, youngsters who earn far more than the unfortunate teens who sell themselves to white tourists at the world-famous Copacabana beach. And they want it to stay that way.The sun rises quickly above the green mountains. The thermometer already shows 28Â°C. Flamengoâ€™s new training ground is in Vargem Grande, 30km outside Rio. The bus journey takes about an hour when the traffic is smooth. Otherwise it takes two.Inside a fenced area, the youngsters get off and disappear into a narrow concrete dressing room. South Americaâ€™s biggest club has called in 50 players aged 15 to 16 for the first peneira of the year. The majority are from the clubâ€™s U15 squad, but a third come from other clubs. All will be tested to see if they have what it takes to play with the U17s.Elton is 16 and comes from Natal in the north-east of Brazil. He has travelled for three days just to be here. Last year, he was one of only two players from a group of 40 to come through a peneira at Nova IguaÃ§u FC, one of several feeder clubs in the Rio suburbs. Now, Eltonâ€™s agent has arranged a trial in Brazilâ€™s most popular peneira.â€œIf I come through this, Iâ€™m safe. Iâ€™ll move here. My mother has a friend of a friend who Iâ€™m sure I can live with,â€￾ says Elton, tying the shoelaces of a brand new pair of Nike Total 90s, a Christmas gift from his agent. He slowly jogs towards the training facilities together with his competitors. Behind them comes the kit man, followed by the physio, the assistant physio, the masseur, the doctor, the goalkeeping coach, the assistant manager and the head coach. Each of Flamengoâ€™s eight youth teams is coached and supervised by an eight-strong staff. Anthony Santoro, the U17 head coach, is last onto the ground. He finds a spot in the shade under a tree. â€œLook,â€￾ says the 36-year-old, pointing a finger towards the 50 sweating teenagers who are running around in the heat like a bunch of scared army recruits. â€œOn Friday there will only be 20.â€￾Brazil is the fifth largest country in the world, has the 11th strongest economy and is the worldâ€™s biggest exporter of iron ore, soya beans, sugar, frozen meat and orange concentrate. Last year, Brazilâ€™s exports were worth more than US$100bn [$122bn].Yet the money is not trickling down. Of Brazilâ€™s 184 million inhabitants, half live in poverty. They work on the streets, with no steady income and no accommodation, polishing shoes, selling peanuts, juggling oranges, washing other peopleâ€™s clothes â€“ anything to earn a crust. The majority survive on less than three dollars a day. Brazilâ€™s social classes have never been so divided. Ten percent of the countryâ€™s population controls almost everything. In the UNâ€™s most recent annual report on income, only diamond-rich Sierra Leone and Central African Republic had a wider gap between rich and poor. According to the IBGE, Brazilâ€™s institute of statistics, wealth distribution also follows racial patterns: 86 percent of the countryâ€™s richest 10 percent are white, 12.6 percent are mixed race and only 1.4 percent are black, even though almost half of Brazilians are black. The rich-poor divide is so entrenched that Brazil has become one of the toughest countries to grow up in. If you are born poor it is almost certain that you will die poor. The fastest way out is through talent: singing, dancing, acting or football. And of the boys, the majority choose football.The first obstacle for these millions of potential footballers is the peneira, which means â€œstrainerâ€￾ in Portuguese. All the nationâ€™s talents are thrown in, and out come the very best the worldâ€™s greatest football country can offer. Meanwhile, the unwanted, weak elements are left behind. Itâ€™s survival of the fittest; Darwinism applied to football. The first peneira was held shortly after British visitors brought football to Brazil late in the 19th Century. Today, it is an industry in Brazil, with many clubs charging young hopefuls for the privilege of taking part.The Sao Cristovao club in Rio arranges one of the most popular peneiras. At the steel gate that leads to the bumpy, worn pitch, graffiti reads: Aqui naceu o Fenomeno â€“ â€œThe Phenomenon was born here.â€￾Ronaldo had only been playing for a couple of years when, aged 13, he made it through Sao Cristovaoâ€™s peneira. Two years later, encouraged by his father who had always been a Flamenguista, he attended a trial at Flamengo. The youth coach didnâ€™t spot his talent. Others did. Two years on, Ronaldo made his debut in the national U17 team.Flamengo have learned from their costly mistake. Today they do not miss a thing. They would rather test 1000 hopeless cases than let slip one potential superstar. Flamengoâ€™s headquarters are located in the shady district of Gavea in southern Rio. Every day from 9am to 5pm, guided tours visit the facilities. The colours on the walls have begun to come off and weeds have spread so far over the paths that you canâ€™t see where you are walking. The rubble of a demolished building lies where it fell. It was thought that the club would build a gym there, but somehow the money disappeared.Most visitors are domestic tourists from one of the countryâ€™s 27 states. Flamengo is the only club in Brazil with supporters all over the country. It does not matter where Flamengo are playing, it always feels as if they are playing at home. It is claimed that they have 25.6 million supporters in the country, almost twice as many as the other Rio clubs put together. The fans call their club MaÃ§ao Rubro-Negro: â€œThe red and black nation.â€￾A famous expression is painted on the wall that surrounds one of the pitches inside Gavea: Craque, o Flamengo faze m casa â€“ â€œFlamengo raises the real players.â€￾ This cocky phrase was coined in 1981 when a Zico-inspired Flamengo won the Intercontinental Cup with seven of the starting 11 homegrown. Twenty-five years on, Flamengo wants to return to those days. That is why the club has established one of the continentâ€™s largest player factories.The key man is Tito Araujo, the 52-year-old chief of the clubâ€™s recruitment office. He decides which boys will be part of one of the five classes in the education programme: Pre-Mirim (under-11), Mirim (under-13), Infantil (under-15), Juvenil (under-17) and Juniores (under-20). Araujo works from an office behind the training groundâ€™s enormous concrete stand, sitting straight-backed at a desk that has seen better days. Two years ago, he returned from Qatar, where he had been a physio for five years. Tacky pennants and team photos are stuck to the wall. In between them, patches of mould have created their own continents. The air conditioning rumbles noisily.In front of Araujo are two mobile phones. One of them vibrates.â€œFutebol,â€￾ he answers, and leans back on his chair. His questions come automatically.â€œHas he played for a club before? Which club? What position? All right, take him to a clinic, do an ECG and a regular medical. Send the papers to me by FedEx. You know the address. Write my name on the top and the papers will be sent to me directly.â€￾For the last couple of weeks, says Araujo, the phones have barely stopped ringing. â€œMost of the time it is the mothers,â€￾ he admits. â€œThey say their son is the best in their neighbourhood. What do we know? Flamengo cannot afford to miss out so we invite him for a trial. Behind a simple call like this, there might be a gold nugget.â€￾He pulls out his top drawer and throws some membership cards on the desk. The first shows a skinny eight-year-old: Adriano Leite Ribeiro, member number 24,047. â€œLook at this! His mother called. We signed him straight after the first trial. He got money for the bus and free healthcare. Check out the autograph. Cute, isnâ€™t it?â€￾Every year, Araujo scours the country for new talent. In Rio alone, Flamengo have 23 football academies, with another 27 across Brazil. Then thereâ€™s Araujoâ€™s team of olheiros [eyes] who visit every pitch in the cityâ€™s narrow suburbs. The club has daily contact with feeder clubs who frequently send their best players. Those who believe that playful football on the beaches explains why Brazil has exported 3087 professional players in the last four years might like to reconsider. In fact, it is the result of hard work and a military discipline that cannot be found anywhere else in the world.â€œI get upset at those who believe that players grow on trees here,â€￾ says Araujo. â€œWe have advantages, like a climate that makes it possible to play all year around and a history that appeals to younger boys. But really, it is our consistent work with the children that makes it possible.â€￾He leans over his desk. â€œTake any player in the national team. Everyone has started in a football academy. As eight-year-olds. They are professional even before they become teenagers.â€￾ The other mobile phone on the desk vibrates. â€œFutebol,â€￾ he answers, straightening his back. He listens carefully and takes some notes. One of his olheiros has spotted a nine-year-old in the province of Espirito Santo, an eight-hour bus journey from Rio. â€œWhen he calls, things are looking good,â€￾ he smiles. â€œWeâ€™ve had many good boys from there.â€￾He walks towards a wall covered in pictures of the players in the Pre-Mirim. â€œIf I only can get two or three players to go all the way to the first team or to Europe,â€￾ he sighs, â€œit will pay for all our work.â€￾The route to professional football in Brazil begins with futsal, a Brazilian/Uruguayan invention that spread across the continent during the 1930s and which is mainly played indoors on basketball courts, with four players and a goalkeeper in each team. In Brazil the youngest futsal category is chupetinha, â€œthe dummyâ€￾, for those precocious boys under seven.River FC is one of Rioâ€™s most successful futsal clubs, the place where Zico, Flamengoâ€™s greatest ever player, began. Today, the clubâ€™s 39-year-old youth trainer Racinha is directing his seven-year-olds. It is 9am. The boys are flying across the shiny wooden floor, attacking the goal constantly. This is not for fun; they are following a method. They already know the basic strategy of football â€“ they even kiss their badges when they score. â€œItâ€™s never too early to begin,â€￾ laughs Racinha.The indoor hall is a two-level concrete building from the 1960s that must have impressed people back then. Lamps in the ceiling cast a sterile light over the mothers and fathers who lean over the barriers, cheering for their kids.River FC was founded in 1914 by a group of students who thought that Rio sounded cooler in English. For several decades the club played in Rioâ€™s Carioca Championship, but now River only play futsal. It became too expensive to maintain a grass pitch. Boys begin here at six or seven years old, and itâ€™s not until they have been taught all the technical aspects of the game that they are released onto the grass. â€œI canâ€™t understand what youâ€™re doing in Europe,â€￾ says Racinha, shaking his head. â€œYouâ€™re developing marathon runners. Your enormous pitches are breaking down the boys â€“ there is no joy. Football should begin with a lot of ball contact and technique, in small areas. Look at Zico or Ronaldinho. Amazing players! Ronaldo, Robinho, Adriano: they all began with futsal. The entire â€˜Magic Quartetâ€™ was formed here.â€￾ He points towards the seven-year-olds hurtling around the 25m by 18m floor. â€œLook at the pace! This is the secret of Brazilian footballâ€™s wonder.â€￾When the dummy class has finished, itâ€™s time for the fraldinha [diapers]. â€œLook at Lenny,â€￾ Racinha says. â€œThe guy with the long hair. Fluminense have already offered him a contract. Donâ€™t you think heâ€™s special?â€￾Football comes easily to Lenny. He finds the best passes and controls the ball impressively. But whether he is a future proâ€¦ well, thatâ€™s another thing entirely.River has 30 players in every group and a third of them will be approached by one of Rioâ€™s three big clubs before they have turned 10. Earlier this year, Vasco da Gama and Flamengo had a dispute over an eight-year-old called Fabinho from Pavuna, a miserable suburb up north. Vasco offered the kidâ€™s father 500 reais [$300] per month â€“ more than a federal minimum wage and easily enough to rent a three-room apartment in the suburb. Flamengo, who already had him in their academy, offered free education, health care and dental care if he stayed. Fabinhoâ€™s unemployed father thought for a while and made a decision. A lifelong Flamenguista, he declined the cash. This situation should not exist. One of few things PelÃ© achieved as Sport Minister in the late-â€™90s was a piece of legislation prohibiting so-called â€œslaveryâ€￾ within Brazilian football. Previously, clubs did not have to pay anything to their younger players and owned the playerâ€™s registration as soon as he signed for the club. But in March 1998, â€œPelÃ©â€™s lawâ€￾ stated that all players should be free until they turned 16. The problem is that smaller clubs who develop a player from the age of eight risk losing out financially if the player changes club as a junior. And instead of being tied to their clubs, players are now firmly tied to their agents.Two sexagenarians, Olivia and Ney, watch from the side. They run a photo agency, and are working for Rioâ€™s futsal association. â€œDo the clubs pay the boys? Damn right they do,â€￾ snorts Olivia. â€œNot serious clubs like Flamengo and Fluminense, but agents and other clubs pay. They write contracts with parents and tie boys to their clubs.â€￾Isnâ€™t that forbidden? Olivia leans forward. â€œLook,â€￾ she shrugs, â€œthis is Brazil. Here anything is possible. There are agents and clubs that pay 1000 reais [$600] per month. Thatâ€™s a lot of money for a 10-year-old, more than a nurse makes. This hunt for talent has become absolutely crazy. The agents are fighting each other. If they can strike a deal and export one of their players, theyâ€™ll make 100 times more than their expenses accounts.â€œIâ€™m upset with the parents,â€￾ she says. â€œWhat happens if the boy stops developing? If he doesnâ€™t make it through the next peneira? What will the parents then do then? They are depending on their sonâ€™s wages. Thatâ€™s a burden that no young boy should have.â€￾ Back in Vargem Grande, Flamengoâ€™s legendary youth trainer, 62-year-old Liminha, is yelling at the under-20 players. With a crew cut that has turned grey, he looks like an old captain in the US Army.â€œLads!â€￾ he yells. â€œI donâ€™t want to see you running around outside the dressing room in sandals with your shirt outside your shorts. Youâ€™re not boys any more. You are Flamengos! Youâ€™re here to work. Understood?â€￾ Flamengoâ€™s training ground is built on land bought by the clubâ€™s president in 1981. Apart from a sentry box, the ground was unused for over 20 years until the president decided to build his player factory. The plans feature a restaurant, a hotel, a swimming pool, a small stadium and five pitches â€“ one for each youth category. So far, only the U20 and U17 pitches are covered in grass. Two others await their turf while the first-team pitch is just a big hole. When itâ€™s finished it will be next to the swimming pool, which has not been started.â€œFlamengo is short of money,â€￾ says Tito Araujo. â€œAt the moment, we are 213 million reais [$125.5m] in debt. We cannot make it if we donâ€™t get a foreign investor.â€￾Somehow the club has contrived to lose all of the US$40m [$48.5m] that Swiss-based investor ISL provided four years ago. That the money did not reach Flamengo is obvious when you look at their facilities and recent league positions.â€œWe must pull off this project if we are to get back on track,â€￾ says Araujo, pointing to the pitches. â€œThe U11 pitch will be here and the other pitches will come right after that. We want the players to have goals. They start here, and go further up as they develop. Furthest up, the first team will train here. Itâ€™s good for motivation. The younger guys will see that it is possible to reach their target, while the professionals will see that younger guys are ready to take their place if they donâ€™t perform.â€￾ The sun is boiling. We are standing under some trees by the U17 pitch where Anthony Santoro is busy with his 50 trialists. So far, no one has been rejected. â€œI want to give them an honest chance,â€￾ he says. â€œOn Friday I will make up my mind. Time will tell.â€￾A traditional peneira consists of six teams, all playing against each other until the coach has an opinion. Then the selection begins. The coach switches players about with no explanation. Everyone knows he is trying to form the best team, but whether it is the team in the yellow vests, in the green, the blue, or in Flamengoâ€™s red-and-black jersey, only the coach knows. The selection of the U17 team is the toughest of all. Because they train as much as the U20s and the first team, Peleâ€™s law forces the clubs to offer them real contracts. Thus Flamengo must pay wages, health care and holiday compensation â€“ and they will only do this if they believe they can get something in return.Santoro calls out the names of the players in the first two teams. The physio and the assistant coach hand out some vests. Elton, the 16-year-old from Natal, does not get one. â€œItâ€™s my turn next,â€￾ he says. Rafael, from Alem Paraiba in the Minas Gerias province 200km north of Rio, wants a spot as a right-sided midfielder. â€œIt didnâ€™t really work yesterday,â€￾ he says. â€œI hope I get the chance to show what I can do today.â€￾ In his hand he holds a white card, just like the one Elton has. On the front is his name, height, weight, position and latest club. On the back are seven lines, one for each day of the peneira. Each day, Santoro must sign the card. If he doesnâ€™t, the player gets a barca passou, a boat that takes him away. Elton, a striker, has seen the boat pass several times. â€œThis time Iâ€™ll make it,â€￾ he insists. â€œIâ€™m tired of my club in Natal. Never any money, bad training. To play with Flamengo is like playing in Europe.â€￾ The next two teams are called out. Neither Elton nor Rafaelâ€™s name comes. They look nervously at their white cards. The first group guzzle cold water and pour it in their shoes. Their feet are burning, blistered by the bone-hard surface.â€œIâ€™m sure weâ€™ll get to play next time,â€￾ says Elton, adjusting his shinpads. â€œThere are so many players. I just have to prove that Iâ€™m better than they are.â€￾Fifteen minutes later, itâ€™s finally their turn. They put on the green jerseys and gently tuck their white cards in their socks behind the shinpads. Jorge, the masseur, is standing next to the water tank. â€œPoor sherry, playing in this heat,â€￾ he mutters.By 11am itâ€™s too hot to play any more, so the players return to the concrete dressing rooms and form a line at the tiny shower area. As he waits, Wellington, a friend of Paulo Sergio, tells his story. He comes from Novo Friburgo in the mountains north of Rio de Janeiro and began playing for Flamengo when he was 10. He initially lived in Rio during the week and went back to his mother for weekends. Now he plays matches at the weekend so heâ€™s moved into the clubâ€™s accommodation.â€œItâ€™s not too bad,â€￾ he says. â€œA woman cooks for us and helps with our laundry. At the most, we sleep 10 boys in one room.â€￾Whenever there is a peneira, the building gets crowded. â€œIt can be very lively, but we have to behave. The management wants us to attend school in the afternoons, but we normally get back from training at 1pm and school begins at two. So we have to choose: shower or lunch? Thereâ€™s no time for both.â€œAt the start of every season, I decide to do my best in school. I say to myself that I must attend all the classes. The first dayâ€™s not a problem. Neither is the second. On the third day it begins to get harder. My mother is always telling me how important school is. She calls every day to ask how things were. I always tell her the same: â€˜goodâ€™.â€￾At 4pm, Wellingtonâ€™s friends in the U20 team face Fluminense. Everyone wants to watch their elders kicking the crap out of their biggest rivals. The undoubted star is 19-year-old Zelio Junior, who already makes more than 3,000 reais [Â£740] a month. Heâ€™s well on his way to changing his familyâ€™s life. Not that it stops his mother yelling from the stands. â€œI never miss a match,â€￾ she says. â€œThey need me here. Life as a player in Flamengo is tough. They cannot afford to lose.â€￾Beside her sits Margarethe, mother of Marlon, central defender and captain. Marlon is busy but managing well. Then he makes a mistake and the ball finds its way into the goal. His mother looks like she wants to vanish. â€œMy son, my son,â€￾ she sighs and hides her face in her hands.Adriana Lacerda is a beautiful 28-year-old with short black hair, warm brown eyes and big earrings. She is employed as the chief psychologist of Flamengoâ€™s youth department. Every team has its own full-time psychologist â€“ yet another detail that distinguishes Brazilian youth football from the rest of the world.â€œAt least 80 percent of our players come from poor conditions,â€￾ she says. â€œThey donâ€™t have health insurance. Many have never visited a dentist.â€￾Her tiny consulting room is next door to Tito Araujoâ€™s recruitment room. At a round table that takes up almost the whole room, she holds individual talks with the boys during the season. â€œThe first thing I do with a player that has been accepted is to have a thorough conversation,â€￾ she explains. â€œI have to know everything about the player and his family in order to help him. There are often problems within the family. The mother and father are arguing. The father wants the son to perform better and bring in more money while the mother wants the son to study more. The pressure is huge.â€œParents believe all their problems are solved just because Flamengo has accepted their child,â€￾ she continues, â€œbut the selection process is cruel. Time after time, I try to explain that only a few go all the way. They have to make sure that their child continues with his studies.â€￾Last season, Lacerda collected phrases the boys had said during individual sessions. â€œWithout mentioning any names, I gave the parents a presentation. â€˜When I get home my father is always asking me how it went on the training. When I tell him it went OK, he gets upset and turns his back on me. It is very hard.â€™ Many could see what they were doing.â€￾The door to Lacerdaâ€™s office opens. Erick Conde, psychologist for the Juvenil set-up, is concerned about one of the players currently going through the peneira. â€œDo you think itâ€™s possible to talk about him later? Just the two of us?â€￾ FourFourTwo asks what Lacerda says to a 16-year-old who has played with Flamengo since he was eight and is suddenly forced to leave the club. â€œHe takes care of that,â€￾ she says, pointing towards Araujoâ€™s office. â€œNormally he calls a meeting with the parents and the player. He tells them that the player has not developed as much as they were hoping, that he is free to try another club.â€￾Free?â€œWhat else can we say? Itâ€™s hard. Many tears. The good thing is that the player can easily get a spot in one of the smaller clubs, but naturally, the boys who are leaving are very sad.â€￾That most of the players come from extreme conditions is something Lacerda has been forced to get used to. Of 150 players in Flamengoâ€™s developing teams, only 10 percent are from the middle class or above it. â€œFootball is a game for the poor, not the rich. For middle-class kids, it is more like a hobby. A bunch of friends might get together and play, but their parents want them to become lawyers, doctors or engineers. Not footballers.â€￾Sure enough, Socrates and Kaka are the only middle-class kids ever to have represented Brazil. The infamous suburb Tavares Bastos is located on the mountains outside Flamengo. Five years ago, this suburb was known for cocaine and marijuana. Young motorcyclists drove the middle classes here so they could buy their stuff. The lines were extra long on Friday afternoons: a â€˜whiteâ€™ line for cocaine, a â€˜brownâ€™ line for marijuana. Charismatic drug dealer Borel ran the market. He loved football and made sure his battles with the police never came in the way of the small pitch he had funded. His men were told to escape into the rainforest if the police dared to approach them.This is where Paulo Sergio was raised. â€œI got my first football clothes from Borel. He wanted me to be a goalkeeper. He gave me the lot â€“ shorts, shirt, everything.â€￾Paulo Sergioâ€™s mother works as a maid for an elderly woman; his father, Antonio, is working in a garage down by the beach, parking residentsâ€™ cars. As an extra job, he drives a taxi. Antonio built the familyâ€™s house himself. They pay 20 reais [Â£5] a month for 60 different TV channels, among them the privately owned SporTV and ESPN Brasil. The bookshelf in the living room is filled with trophies. â€œMy dad was a central defender. He was champion several times at the soil pitches in the Flamengo Park,â€￾ says Paulo Sergio proudly.Antonio nods his head. â€œWe were the toughest team,â€￾ he says, rolling up histrousers to reveal battered legs showing the scars of 20 years of football. In Paulo Sergioâ€™s room there are many medals. Most are from his futsal career. â€œHe was the best,â€￾ his father says. â€œWhen he turned nine he got his first salary, 500 reais [Â£123] a month. And this computer.â€￾An old PC is squeezed between video tapes and magazines on a desk. Itâ€™s hardly bleeding-edge, but itâ€™s solid evidence of what clubs will do to hold on to players. Vasco had seen Paulo in a tournament and wanted to sign him. â€œI went to his club Hebraica in Laranjeiras and told the chairman. â€˜I donâ€™t know what to do. Vasco are willing to give Paulo 700 reais [Â£173] per month if he starts playing for them.â€™ He was stunned. He said: â€˜All right, this is what weâ€™ll do. Iâ€™ll buy a computer for him. Is that OK?â€™â€￾ He laughs out loud.When Paulo joined Flamengo a year later, he did not get any money from the transfer. â€œTo be a part of Flamengoâ€™s squad is the best thing for him. Itâ€™s a good education and he can easily go to another club later. But when he turns 16, they must show us some money. Heâ€™s not playing for free,â€￾ laughs Antonio.Life in Tavares Bastos has improved since the municipality moved the headquarters of the military police here five years ago. Borel and his fellows escaped through the rainforest to other suburbs. â€œIâ€™ve never had any problems. We live an easy life here on the hill,â€￾ says Paulo Sergio and looks out over Sugarloaf Mountain and Flamengo. We walk down to the football ground where Paulo began his career. The municipality have made sure that Borelâ€™s old soil pitch has become a grass pitch. â€œI got my spot,â€￾ he grins. â€œThe peneira is over. I will be one of the strikers. Wellington made it as well. We will be a strong team this year.â€￾ What about the others? â€œI donâ€™t know. Anthony refused 10 players this Friday. Maybe there will be 10 more this week. He doesnâ€™t want too many. What happened to Elton?â€œElton?â€￾The strikerâ€œOh, the guy from Natal? The boat took him away.â€￾A couple of days later, we are back in Tito Araujoâ€™s office. The Juvenil group is formed. Araujoâ€™s mission statement is that in a few years Flamengo should be able to field a first team consisting of seven homegrown players. The U20 team already has several players on their way up â€“ among them Zelio Junior, who many believe will be a big star. Those who are left, the club hope they can sell overseas. â€œIf you donâ€™t have what it takes, then youâ€™re out,â€￾ says Araujo. â€œThatâ€™s life. For you to become a journalist you had to fight, right?â€￾â€œNot from the age of eight,â€￾ I say.He is silent for a few seconds. â€œWhat can I say?

"Milan on Rossi trail Sunday 8 July, 2007 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------European champions Milan are set to make an offer to Manchester United for Italian starlet Giuseppe Rossi.The youngster has been made available for transfer by the Old Trafford outfit given the likely arrival of Carlos Tevez from West Ham.Parma have already made a Â£6m offer for the Under-21 international, but the Italian giants are ready to outbid them.Stories in the peninsula on Sunday claim that Rossi would be willing to join Milan, even if he does have a bond with Parma after his goals kept them in the top-flight during his loan stint last term.Milan are expected to make a formal financial proposal once Vice-President Adriano Galliani holds transfer status talks with owner Silvio Berlusconi on Tuesday.The Rossoneri are looking for new striking options, especially as Ricardo Oliveira is on the verge of joining Real Zaragoza on loan.His departure will leave boss Carlo Ancelotti with just three options in the shape of Ronaldo, Alberto Gilardino and veteran Pippo Inzaghi.Juventus, at the request of former Parma boss Claudio Ranieri, and Porto are also understood to be pondering a Rossi bid.Meanwhile, Galliani has rejected claims in Spain that Kakaâ€™s new contract â€“ which they are working on â€“ will include a rescission clause in it.â€œThese things donâ€™t exist in Italian football,â€￾ noted the official. â€œThis rumour has nothing to do with reality.â€￾Milan are keen to tie down the Brazilian to a fresh deal in a bid to keep him from wanting a Real Madrid transfer.

"Alberto Gilardinoâ€™s time at Milan appears to be up after he threatened to walk out and Carlo Ancelotti opened the door â€“ ushering in Thierry Henry.The striker caused controversy with an interview in this weekendâ€™s â€˜Gazzetta dello Sportâ€™ in which he said he could â€œnot guaranteeâ€￾ he would stay at the club next season, as he demanded more faith in his abilities.â€œIf Gilardino feels he needs to go, then thereâ€™s no reason why we canâ€™t help him achieve that aim, as long as we find a valid alternative,â€￾ replied the Coach.â€œUp until a few days ago he seemed relaxed and the situation was under control. He speaks of faith and fair play, but we have always put our trust in him. I always considered him an important player, even if at Milan competition for places is mandatory.â€￾With Ronaldo no longer cup-tied, Pippo Inzaghi in sparkling form and rumours of another major striker brought in this summer, Gilardino fears he will be pushed aside.â€œCompetition must act as further motivation to do better and certainly not feel like a weight. Gilardino is young, can still improve and has already scored a lot of goals. Like everyone, he has had his ups and downs.â€￾Gila is very unpopular with a section of the Rossoneri fans and admits he was bitterly disappointed at losing out to Inzaghi in the Champions League Final starting XI.â€œThe only player at Milan who is sure of always being first choice is Kaka,â€￾ continued Ancelotti. â€œEveryone should take Inzaghi as an example, a player who takes his profession very seriously. He is always ready and works hard no matter what, so he earned his place in the most important match.â€￾Not only did SuperPippo play in Athens, he scored both goals in the 2-1 victory over Liverpool.â€œIt is often said that Inzaghi is in love with the goal, but the truth is that the goal is in love with him.â€￾That Champions League triumph will act as further incentive to bring in top stars, as Ronaldinho, Samuel Etoâ€™o, Andriy Shevchenko and Emerson have been strongly linked.â€œWe are working to make the team more competitive. What you read in the papers is more or less true, specifically our intention to bring in a midfielder and a forward. Negotiations are tricky, as they involve talking to very prestigious clubs.â€￾The Coach let slip that one of those target is Arsenal hitman Henry, who may finally be ready to leave the Gunners.â€œHenry is a great striker and is among those players who are of interest to us,â€￾ said the Milan boss.There are claims this weekend that a deal for Real Madrid man Emerson has already been secured, with a return to Serie A after his spells at Roma and Juventus.â€œI have not named names and do not wish to, but Emerson is a player with the characteristics that would be useful for us.â€￾","Mon Jun 04, 2007 12:01 pm",12,1651,World Football,"Milan - Gilardino out, Thierry Henry In?"

"Ibra wants Milan move! Sunday 27 May, 2007 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Zlatan Ibrahimovic has approached Milan to ask for a transfer, hints Carlo Ancelotti. â€œNobody would suspect him. If I reveal his name, itâ€™ll be chaosâ€¦â€￾It was no secret that the Rossoneri were close to signing former Juventus man Ibra last summer, but because they had to wait until their Champions League preliminary round was completed to know their strategy, Inter got there first.Now that he has been a key figure in the Nerazzurriâ€™s Scudetto triumph and Milan are champions of Europe, there are claims he wants to move on.â€œMany champions have approached us. They all want us now,â€￾ smiled Ancelotti in yesterdayâ€™s Press conference.â€œThat includes one player who is totally above suspicion. If I reveal his name, itâ€™ll be chaosâ€¦â€￾The newspapers this morning all agree on one thing â€“ that man is Inter hero Ibrahimovic.Already linked with Real Madrid, the real reason for his contract renegotiation problems is a desire to cross the city like Ronaldo, Andrea Pirlo and Clarence Seedorf before him.The Swede has reportedly asked for a substantial pay increase from the current Â£4m per season to at least Â£5.5m.He also bitterly criticised the club this week, comparing them unfavourably to the disgraced Juventus side led by Luciano Moggi.â€œMy agent is currently negotiating a wage increase at Inter. I hope Massimo Moratti is as decisive now as when he signed me,â€￾ explained the former Ajax man.â€œAt Juve, they were a lot clearer on certain things. Moggi was removed because we won too much. It was all jealousy. When I arrived at Inter, the first thing I advised Moratti was to bring in Luciano and change their mentality. Luckily, we won anywayâ€¦â€œThey are two great teams, but that Juve had something more. There was a sense of cohesion that still isnâ€™t present at Inter,â€￾ he told â€˜Liberoâ€™ newspaper.â€œLast year when someone played badly, the other teammates lifted him up. Here it is the opposite â€“ whoever plays below par drags the rest of the squad down with him. Inter are still learning what it takes to be at the top.â€￾This transfer story could bring relations between the two â€˜cuginiâ€™ to an all-time low.

"Beckham: I wanted Milan Saturday 26 May, 2007 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Beckham told the â€˜Gazzetta dello Sportâ€™ that the toughest decision of his career was turning down Milan to join LA Galaxy and explains why Antonio Cassano is â€œcrazy.â€￾The Real Madrid manâ€™s contract expires next month and in January he was free to negotiate with a number of clubs.Milan announced they had been his number one option if Becks had decided to stay in Europe and the player admits that is true.â€œIt was not easy to say no to Milan, one of the best clubs in the world. The squad, the Coach, the President, the city and then Ronaldo went there too. It was a very tough choice,â€￾ said the England international who today received a surprise recall from Steve McClaren for the friendly against Brazil and Euro 2008 qualifier in Estonia.â€œI was honoured, flattered and tempted. But I had to think about my family and wanted a different challenge.â€œI am well aware that football in the States cannot be compared to that in Europe, but I see it as a challenge. I am not just going there to play, I am an ambassador for a movement.â€œI would have liked to play in Serie A. Italy is a country I love because it has everything â€“ great football, great players, the best food in the world, wine, fashion, countryside. Last year I was in Portofino and have often gone to Tuscany. We even thought of getting a house there.â€￾Former Real teammate Ronaldo was celebrating the Champions League trophy in Athens and Beckham could have been there with him.â€œIt was a deserved success, especially considering everything they did during the season. The second leg against Manchester United was the perfect performance. Milan play great football, work hard, score fantastic goals and have extraordinary talents like Kaka.â€￾Liverpool felt they were unfortunate after losing the Final 2-1 on Wednesday, but Beckham does not see it that way.â€œLiverpool know it too, Milan played better in Athens and they won. Filippo Inzaghi has scored extraordinary goals, important goals and fortunate goals. But you cannot talk about luck really in his case â€“ he has been hitting the back of the net all his life and is to be admired.â€￾The race for the Ballon dâ€™Or is Milan-heavy this year and captain Paolo Maldini is in the running.â€œHe deserves to challenge for it with Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo. Anyone who at the age of 39 is playing in a club like Milan and has the respect that Maldini commands deserves to win. But it will be difficult.â€￾Beckham is a teammate of current European and World Player of the Year Fabio Cannavaro and another Italian talent, Antonio Cassano, at Real.â€œThey are very different, both great lads. Cassano is crazy, but heâ€™s also one of the nicest people Iâ€™ve ever met. He is always happy, ready to laugh and joke around, not to mention a real talent. Iâ€™d like him to play more.â€œCannavaro is one of the best defenders I have ever known. We got on well off the field as well, weâ€™re good friends.â€￾The same cannot be said of Coach Fabio Capello, who often clashed with Beckham at the Bernabeu and froze him out after he signed for LA Galaxy.â€œHe is one of the greatest managers in the world. Whatever you may say about him, his career speaks for itself. He is a winner, someone who believes in his players and is on our side.

"Ancelotti: Bring me Barca stars Saturday 26 May, 2007 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Carlo Ancelotti is already looking to next season and his wish list includes Ronaldinho, Samuel Etoâ€™o and Philippe Mexes.â€œI think that to remain at the top of European football, this side needs a few additions,â€￾ said the Coach who took Milan to their seventh Champions League trophy this week.â€œIf we are to sign players, then you may as well make it a real world class figure.

He is one of the strongest central defenders on the transfer market,â€￾ added the Coach when asked about the Roma star.The days after the Rossoneriâ€™s Champions League heroics have been dominated by controversy over a banner insulting Inter that appeared in Massimo Ambrosiniâ€™s hand on the open-top bus.â€œI think Ambrosini made a mistake and he understood that, so he apologised. That has to be the end of the matter.â€￾Milan were cross with their â€˜cuginiâ€™ after President Massimo Moratti, Coach Roberto Mancini and captain Javier Zanetti repeatedly stated they hoped the San Siro giants would lose the Final in Athens.â€œInter have the right to celebrate their Scudetto because they deserved it, but the same goes for Milan and the Champions League. Everyone makes fun of their rivals, it is part of football and totally normal.â€￾The season isnâ€™t over yet, as Milan travel to the Stadio Granillo to face a Reggina side battling to stay in Serie A.â€œWe must try to send out a competitive squad that can give a dignified performance so that we do not unfairly tip the relegation battle in anyoneâ€™s favour,â€￾ noted the tactician after last nightâ€™s party at San Siro.â€œAmbrosini picked up a knock, while Paolo Maldini, Inzaghi and Kaka also have a few problems. Weâ€™re also without Ronaldo and the suspended Ricardo Oliveira and Yoann Gourcuff.â€￾Gilardino is expected to start upfront alongside former Reggina youngster Marco Borriello.Meanwhile, Maldini will extend his career for another season by going under the knife for a recurring knee problem.â€œPaolo always makes his own decisions,â€￾ said his father, Cesare. â€œOn Tuesday morning heâ€™ll fly to Belgium for surgery and will return to the field at Milanello in two months.â€￾","Sun May 27, 2007 12:42 am",0,295,World Football,Ancelotti

"Berlusconi picks supersub Pippo Sunday 20 May, 2007 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Milan President Silvio Berlusconi has suggested starting the Champions League Final with Alberto Gilardino, bringing on Pippo Inzaghi for the late push.â€œBy Wednesday we will all be in top form. We cannot let the trophy slip through our fingers again,â€￾ he told â€˜Telelombardia.â€™Coach Carlo Ancelotti has said he is yet to decide which of his two strikers will start in Athens, so Berlusconi made his suggestion.â€œIf it were up to me, I would start with Gilardino as centre-forward and then bring on Inzaghi when the Liverpool defence is a little more tired.â€￾It is practically certain that the rest of the formation is decided with Kaka and Clarence Seedorf supporting the forward.The only other doubt is between Paolo Maldini and Kakha Kaladze at centre-back, which depends on the captainâ€™s fitness levels.Yesterday Milanâ€™s reserves lost 3-2 to Udinese, but the day was above all a celebration for Alessandro â€˜Billyâ€™ Costacurta, who is retiring at the age of 41 to become Ancelottiâ€™s assistant manager alongside Mauro Tassotti.â€œThe Presidentâ€™s role is to motivate the team and give the mission statement to the Coach and players,â€￾ said Berlusconi.â€œI donâ€™t think our results in my 21 years here have been all that badâ€¦ Ancelotti, Tassotti and Costacurta are great friends and this atmosphere will certainly help the work done at Milanello.â€￾If one old face is moving on, then another could return, as the patron and former Italian Prime Minister has again invited Andriy Shevchenko to end his Chelsea spell.â€œThe doors are not just open for Sheva, they are spread out wide for him.

"Boy who cried wolf - Tim Vickery Despite the driving rain a crowd of nearly 60,000 flocked to Rioâ€™s Maracana stadium to try and cheer local heroes Flamengo in to the quarter finals of the Copa Libertadores, South Americaâ€™s version of the UEFA and AFC Champions Leagues.They went home wetter and sadder. Captain Renato scored two extraordinary long range goals with his howitzer left foot but it was not enough to claw back the 3-0 lead established in the first leg by Defensor of Uruguay.In the aftermath of the 3-2 aggregate defeat, Flamengoâ€™s players and the Rio media were quick to pin the blame on a usual suspect - the referee.But if officialdom had any part in their downfall the fault was not so much with Hector Baldassi, the experienced and respected Argentine ref that handled the second leg tie.Rather, the problem lies with the referees that Flamengo come up against week in week out in domestic Brazilian football. They consistently give fouls that would not be awarded anywhere else in the world - not in European football, not in the World Cup and not, as Flamengo found to their cost, in the Copa Libertadores.One of the leading Brazilian referees, Leonardo Gaciba, explained the problem to me late last year.â€œA characteristic of the Brazilian player is that he will look for the foul. Elsewhere in South America even after there has been contact the player still wants the ball, still wants to continuethe move,"" he said.""But in Brazil the player would rather go down and take the foul. And the media here see 20 penalties per game that should have been given.â€￾So the pressure in Brazil, from players, press and supporters, is to blow the whistle.â€œThe referee has to be a chameleon,â€￾ continued Gaciba. â€œHe has to adapt to the circumstances. The criteria I use in a Copa Libertadores match is not the same as for a domestic game here.â€￾Brazilian players are not always capable of the same level of adaptation.Flamengoâ€™s Renato Augusto certainly wasnâ€™t against Defensor. The tall 19-year-old is an attacking midfielder of great promise, who at times reminds me of a right footed version of Rivaldo.If he is to have anything like the same global success the game in the Maracana gave him a taste of what to expect and how he has to change.From the first minute to the last Renato Augusto persisted in carrying the ball, going down under the slightest physical challenge and screaming at the referee in revolt when no free kick was given. By and large Baldassi was correct. By any conventional standard of officiating no offence had taken place.But fouls would almost certainly have been given in a Brazilian league game.Leonardo Gaciba readily concedes that the Brazilian style of refereeing can create problems for players who move to Europe. It perhaps helps explain the problems Robinho has encountered establishing himself in the Real Madrid team.I would be a wealthy man indeed if I had a dollar for every time Iâ€™ve seen Robinho on the floor swearing at the referee in Portuguese because he has not been given a foul.Living inside such a protected bubble can also have a detrimental effect on a playerâ€™s technical development. The number of entirely one footed players in Brazilian football is astonishing. In part this is explained by the criteria used by the referee.A player caught with the ball on his â€˜wrongâ€™ foot has an easy way out - turn his back, wait for the slightest physical contact and then go to ground.More often than not he will win a free kick. One of the pillars of the greatness of Brazilian football is the necessity to come up with improvised solutions.Remove the problem and there is no need for the solution. Overprotection means that many players are not forced to work on their weaker foot.There is another problem with the excessive Brazilian love affair with winning a free kick - the global reputation they are beginning to gain for diving.Two years ago Renato Augusto was part of the Brazilian team came second in the Under-17 World Cup in Peru. On the way to the final one of their victims was the Netherlands, whose coach Ruud Kaiser was scathing.â€œThey are the tallest players in the tournament and they arealways on the floor,â€￾ he moaned.Many will recall that the senior side nearly saved themselves at the end after being outplayed by France in the 2006 World Cup quarter final.A blatant dive by Ronaldo fooled the referee in to giving a free kick on the edge of the area, curled just over the bar by Ronaldinho.It nearly saved them in the short term but it might be harmful in the long.It opens Brazil up to the â€˜boy who cried wolfâ€™ problem - the loss of credibility meaning that they are not given a free kick even after they have unquestionably suffered a foul.","Thu May 17, 2007 5:05 pm",0,205,World Football,Boy who cried Wolf - Good read

"Selling The Emperor: Right Or A Wrong? Not any more distant than a couple of years ago Adriano was considered one of the best five players in the world. Many top European clubs would try their best to put their hands on him â€“ in particular Real Madrid were eager to add yet another piece to their Galactic collection. But the Brazilian stayed on, living several troubled months, due to injuries and long spells of poor form.As the season is drawing to a close, the summer transfer market is looming and the grapevine has begun to rustle. Real Madrid are said to be interested in Adriano again, even if they are not willing to spend the same amount of money they were ready to table in the past. Will Moratti send Madrid another striker after the 2002 Ronaldo deal? Maybe this time that would be quite a good move. Luca Manes has a look at the pros and cons of letting the Emperor take his empire to Spain â€¦ Italian football fans got to know Adriano when he scored a great goal in a friendly match against Real Madrid at Santiago BernabÃ©u Stadium. It was a warm night back in August 2001, and the 19 year-old ex-Flamengo future star found the back of the net with an incredible free kick. In fact it was a daisy cutter, a bit of a Roberto Carlos style kick. As I said, he was only young, a big guy with a contagious smile, coming from the tough Rio De Janeiro favelas (shanty towns) and bearing some unpleasant memories of a difficult childhood. He was brought up by a poor family, but football â€“ and Flamengo â€“ came to a rescue, giving him a chance to leave the favelas. After a shining start of his career with the Rubro-negro club, Adriano was noticed by Inter scouts, and a trip to Europe was very soon arranged. At that time Inter was Ronaldoâ€™s realm and â€œlittleâ€￾ Adriano was very happy to join the team his idol was playing for. Actually Ronnie was just recovering from one of his several injuries, and he was also about to live after the fatal May 5th 2002 Lazio-Inter clash (his last match for Inter) and a few arguments with the Argentinean coach CÃºper.In the meantime (January 2002), the younger Brazilian was sent on loan to Fiorentina to play with more regularity. After that spell, ending up with the Viola getting relegated, Moratti decided to sell â€œhalfâ€￾ of his young prospect to Parma. Adrianoâ€™s great performances for the Ducali eventually convinced Moratti to invest some money to get him back from the Gialloblu and to give him the keys of Inter striking force. Adriano was phenomenal at the beginning of his second part of story with the Beneamata (Beloved), deserving the ambitious nickname of L'Imperatore (The Emperor). Ironically, just when all the top clubs' Presidents would have loved to splash a lot of money out on signing him, he started to go downhill with a bullet as both personal and professional aspects of his life went awry.Both physical â€“ muscular â€“ and psychological â€“ attitude problems, coupled with his great passion for the Milan night life and girls who should only go out with paper bags over their heads, proved to be very costly for his career development.At a time when the number 10 should have been sloughing off another cocoon to emerge as the worlds best striker, he did the opposite and even went a horrific nine months without scoring as snaps in the paper could him with a cigarette in one hand and a Fubanga (Brazilian Portuguese for a slapper) in the other.I donâ€™t want to be too provocative, but maybe itâ€™s time to sell Adriano and to cash in before Inter end up with an expensive problem on their hands â€“ and no way out. Maybe it was a mistake not to sell him a couple of seasons ago, when Real Madrid were offering an outrageous amount of money (possibly more than 50 million Euros) or a good deal of players.Right now Moratti must be really uncertain. Heâ€™s already sold a top striker like Ronaldo to Real Madrid, and actually he had some reasons to regret that move (donâ€™t forget that the FenÃ´meno kept scoring for the Casa Blanca as well). But what will he think, if Adriano fails to impress next season? He would get further devaluated, and not many club would get in line to knock on Interâ€™s door with their pockets full of Euros.Inter are said to be interested in Lucarelli as a possible replacement. Heâ€™s definitely a good striker â€“ 18 goals so far this season, 104 in Serie A in the whole career, but is hardly sending Inter fans into joyful delirium.According to current Livorno Coach and former Mancini assistant Orsi, Lucarelli would be a great addiction to Inter. Honestly, as the Nerazzurri patron has decided to confirm Mancini on the Italian championsâ€™ bench, he should be willing please his Coach, and for this reason Adriano may well go. The former Lazio gaffer is not convinced the Brazilian can be that useful for his team anymore. Adriano doesnâ€™t fit in very well in his schemes, as heâ€™s not the kind of player too used to passing the ball or to be very cooperative with his team mates. Obviously if heâ€™s in form â€“ and not too tired after a long night life session â€“ he can win a match by himself, but that hasnâ€™t happened very often recently.Inter might struggle to keep Crespo, while the Recoba future is uncertain as well. Signing Lucarelli could be a god idea, even if Inter have already got an over thirty and experienced-player like Cruz. A good strategy could be getting as much cash as possible from the Adriano departure to invest in a prospect like Reggina striker Bianchi.Then again, if rumours regarding Real Madrid interest are not based on pure fantasy but on concrete intentions, Moratti & co. could bag Diarra as part of the deal.Inter have already got the top quality striker, relying on a world class player like Ibrahimovic. He proved to be highly instrumental in Inter's Scudetto triumph, as he can create chances both for himself and for the rest of the team. Heâ€™s the real phenomenon, and Inter do miss him a lot when heâ€™s not on the pitch â€“ and you can tell just watching the way the Nerazzurri played the Italian Cup final first leg last Wednesday. At the moment heâ€™s injured, but heâ€™ll be back right after the summer. The Interisti supporters canâ€™t wait to see their new Emperor perform again in front of their eyes, so wouldnâ€™t be too sad to have to part company with his â€œpredecessorâ€￾.

"Despite the fact the Jose Mourinho's jibe at Liverpool was uncalled for and below the belt, the fact that Liverpool have not come even close to winning the Premirship under Rafa Benitez, remains. Itâ€™s hard to criticise Liverpool at the moment as they prepare to take part in their second Champions League final in three years. Prior to the so called â€œRafalutionâ€￾ hitting Anfield, football fans worldwide would have laughed at the idea of Liverpool regaining their reputation in Europe - lost over 20 years ago. They have since muted those voices, but business remains very much unfinished. So, why havenâ€™t Liverpool been able to make any strides in breaking their seventeen year Premiership drought?Rafael Benitez came to Liverpool three years ago with a glowing reputation, leading Valencia to two La Liga titles and a Uefa Cup. With this in mind, who could pass judgment on the renewed optimism for the red half of Merseyside? However, the original optimism of the Liverpool faithful has turned into a barrage of unanswered questions, as keen football lovers have been left scratching their heads wondering what Rafa needs to do in order to come close to winning the Premiership. Liverpoolâ€™s away record over the last three years has left a lot to be desired. Losing as many games away from home this season as the likes of Fulham, Reading and Manchester City and more than Everton, Tottenham and Aston Villa there is no wondering why Liverpool have been out of the title race since September. Avoiding Defeat On The RoadDoes Rafa try to avoid defeat first instead of trying to win away from home (the very tactic that yields results in Europe)? With an average of less than a goal a match away from home, there is enough evidence to condemn Rafa for deciding to field one striker for the majority of Liverpool's away matches. It may be more than a coincidence that Liverpool have only won 21 of their last 57 matches away from home in the league. But for some great displays in front of the Kop, that would not even have been sufficient for a Champions League berth!No Creative Lynch PinUnder Rafaâ€™s reign, Liverpool have also struggled to convincingly record positive results against the lower teams of the Premier League. Could it be that Liverpool are missing a creative player with the ability to break down the ultra-defensive strategies employed by bottom teams in the league? The â€œnine men behind the ballâ€￾ tactic employed by many teams, often leads to frustration for the Liverpool supporters. It has become obvious that the principal factor behind Liverpoolâ€™s inconsistency against ultra-defensive tactics is a key creative player, who can break down any defensive wall. He had an in form Pablo Aimar at his disposal at Valencia.The likes of Chelsea and Manchester United have found games against smaller teams no more than a slight obstacle, with the likes of Arjen Robben, Joe Cole, Christiano Ronaldo and Ryan Giggs in their ranks. Just like Scholes and Lampard are brilliant but still need those players, so does Gerrard. He offers a major driving force going forward; however to an extent isnâ€™t that creativive genius teams need. Alonso also likes to dictate the game from way too deep and Luis Garcia (currently injured) seems to only be a temporary fix as he continues to lose possession way too often.Rafa himself is aware of the problem, and has tried to bring in the likes of Daniel Alves and Simao, two world class creative wingers (Alves is pretty much a winger) who would potentially help bring an extra dimension to Liverpoolâ€™s game. However on both occasions was priced out of a potential deal. Zenden, Mark Gonzalez and Pennant don't cut it.Lack Of FundsCan Rafa therefore blame the lack of transfer funds made available by the Liverpool board? Much has been made of the takeover of Chelsea and Manchester United in recent years. Abramovich has spent over $700million in four years on big name players, whilst Glazerâ€™s takeover has allowed Manchester United to indulge in a mammoth move for Michael Carrick. Before that, the likes of Rooney, Ferdinand, Saha, Evra, Alan Smith and Ronaldo had been purchased for close to $200 million, even if averaged intelligently over five years.Rafael Benitez hasnâ€™t, however, had this luxury in the transfer market as he tries to strengthen his squad with the limited amount of money made available to him. Purchases such as Gonzalez, Bellamy and Aurelio have left the Reds in danger of falling further behind the top two. The recent takeover of George Gillett and Tom Hicks should put an end to Rafa continuing his trend of purchasing what many describe as mid-range targets.With the quality that Liverpool have at the moment and the likelihood of a number of world class signings in the summer, the possibilities for Liverpool are endless. The platform has been laid for Rafa to finally show his class and take the Premier League by storm. And he must, or he will quickly run out of excuses!","Tue May 15, 2007 9:36 am",30,2642,World Football,Rafa Must Solve Premiership Problems

"THEY had been greeted at the San Siro by thunder, lightning and torrential rain.And then Manchester United walked into the greatest force of all â€” an AC Milan team playing a brand of football several streets ahead of anything the three English semi-finalists had managed.United went two goals behind in the opening 30 minutes to Kaka and Clarence Seedorf, the outstanding Milan players of the two games and performers a class above anything their opponents possessed.Alex Ferguson gambled on Nemanja Vidic â€” and it didnâ€™t come off.More embarrassing for a manager of his experience was the unravelling of his game plan.Setting up his side with Cristiano Ronaldo on the left and Ryan Giggs on the right, United quickly found themselves outnumbered 5-3 in midfield.Yet Ferguson did nothing until the 40th minute â€” when they had already been trailing 2-0 for 10 minutes.Despite the overpowering evidence of Milanâ€™s superiority, he put too much faith in the attacking qualities of his own side.Fergie believed their fearless, gung-ho football would again see them through.But this wasnâ€™t a run-of-the-mill Everton at Goodison Park. This wasnâ€™t a craven, callow Roma side at Old Trafford.This was the most experienced team in world football, a team heading for its third Champions League final in five years and one with, at its epicentre, a couple of the most extravagantly-talented players in the business.Only for a brief 20 minutes or so during the second half did United offer any serious threat to opponents who always appeared to have the measure of Englandâ€™s champions-elect.But credit to Ferguson the man. As ever, he was at his best in defeat, applauding Milan as he said: â€œThey were better prepared, sharper, quicker to the ball and they pressed well. They were good winners.â€￾And so Athens and Europe is spared the terrifying prospect of a Liverpool-United final and 70,000 Englishmen descending on the Greek capital.Instead it will be a re-run of the epic 2005 contest when Rafa Benitezâ€™s Reds came back from the dead to lift the trophy after a penalty shoot-out.What a prospect we have in store with eight of that nightâ€™s Milan side still plying their trade for the Rossoneri â€” all hellbent on revenge.In the end, Unitedâ€™s appalling away form in Europeâ€™s premier competition proved their undoing.There can be no greater Jekyll and Hyde side in the tournament.Unbeaten at home this season, they had â€” before last night â€” still lost three of their last four Champions League matches on the road and eight of the previous 13.You cannot hope to win the Champions League with a record like that. Added to that was their historical failing at this penultimate hurdle. This was their ninth appearance in the semi-final â€” and their seventh defeat.Much to the consternation of the travelling fans, it took just three minutes into the game for all Unitedâ€™s old faults to resurface.Inside a minute, Kaka powered past the helpless Vidic to lay on a cross that skidded narrowly across the face of the United goal.Two minutes later, visiting keeper Edwin van der Sar produced a miraculous save to keep out an effort from Seedorf.United needed to settle down. Kaka, though, didnâ€™t give them the chance as he drilled his shot past Van der Sar after just 11 minutes.It was the Brazilianâ€™s 10th European goal in 12 games â€” and his 18th strike of the season.Milan had made a blistering start and one that boss Carlo Ancelotti, pumping his fist on the touchline, must have dreamed about. Milan, playing the sort of football that destroyed Liverpool in that first half in Istanbul, did much as they pleased as they waltzed their way round the United midfield.Then, on the half-hour, came a goal that will give Ferguson nightmares for the rest of his career.Heinze then somehow allowed Andrea Pirlo to get in a cross which was headed out by Vidic straight to Seedorf.The triple Champions League winner evaded one tackle by Darren Fletcher, another by Vidic before crashing the ball past Van der Sar.Ferguson had said before the game that United would need the spirit of 1999 to get them through their sternest test yet.In that season, Roy Keane inspired a fabulous comeback in Turin when United trailed 2-0 on the night and 3-1 on aggregate to Juventus in the semi-final second leg. Fergieâ€™s troops fought back to win the match 3-2, 4-3 on aggregate.Last night, though, they had no one with Keaneâ€™s inspirational qualities.And what of Ronaldo? He started with an extravagant flick that went straight to a Milan player and, from that moment, had the crowd and the powerful Gennaro Gattuso on his back.But you canâ€™t take anything away from Milan â€” especially their defending which included some outstanding blocks on the edge of the box. And they managed it all without the services of skipper Paolo Maldini, who had played his 167th European game at Old Trafford.As the game entered its last third, Milan started to slow it all down. On their way to yet another final, they were in no hurry.The steady march on Athens then become a procession when substitute Alberto Gilardino ran clear beyond the United defence to apply the coup de grace.A night that had started with so much hope saw United out-thought, out- manoeuvred and, worst of all, outclassed.And that by a team all Italians â€” quick to ridicule extravagant claims of English club dominance in Europe â€” will point out are trailing in third in Serie A.And this coming from an English journo - kudos to Man U but, they played some good stuff this year.","Thu May 03, 2007 10:22 pm",0,213,World Football,United's blunder 'n lightning

"Ancelotti Sticks Up For Damned DidaThe 3-2 last-minute defeat to Manchester United in last nightâ€™s Old Trafford semi-final first leg has caused no small frustration in Italy. Many Milan fans are screaming for a change between the sticks after Dida made one of his rare, yet visceral, fluffs in the first goal. Given the fact that the keeper was being made into a scapegoat, the tactician has stuck up for his number 1â€¦ In declarations made to Italian sports newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, who had â€“ in common with a number of pundits â€“ rated the Brazilian as Milan's worst player, the Coach was clear that the pros outweighed the cons. ""Dida made some great saves,"" he said. ""The first goal wasn't an easy save because Cristiano Ronaldo was in front of himâ€￾, justified Ancelotti, although with a reservation about a last goal that many see as the one in which Dida had least â€˜guiltâ€™. ""Perhaps he should have covered the near post in Manchester's third goal.""The 33 year-old keeper was awarded the best goalkeeper award in the 2003-04 Scudetto campaign, and the Rossoneri Coach is still hopeful that this is just a blip. Dida had previously caused horror after first arriving and letting a wet ball slip through his hands and into the netAfter a lot of speculation the veteran signed on for a contract extension that will see him stay at Milanello until 2010, although in an increasingly supplementary role if Buffon is bagged. Dida only returned to match fitness on Tuesday after two weeks in dry dock with a shoulder injury - ironically enough the body part that lifted Ronaldo's header up and into his own goal in the fifth minute","Thu Apr 26, 2007 1:27 pm",1,329,World Football,Ancelotti Sticks Up For Damned Dida

We were fortunate with Rio Ferdinandâ€™s own goal and Edwin Van der Sarâ€™s error, but there wasnâ€™t a single moment in that match when we released our grip,â€￾ he told â€˜Il Giornaleâ€™ newspaper.â€œThat constant aggression is the only option against the strongest side in the Premiership. If I were Carlo Ancelotti, I would play with the 4-4-2 system at San Siro, but the 4-4-1-1 at Old Trafford.â€œEven when Manchester United are under pressure, they always manage to score. In the first 20 minutes theyâ€™ll come for Milan like a wolf going for the jugular.â€￾Roma were thrashed 7-1 here in the quarter-finals, but Jordan does not think Milan will fall into the same trap.â€œThe Rossoneri are a lot more experienced in this type of game. Roma took the wrong tactical approach, as they were not prudent enough. Milan will not make that mistake and have players who are guarantees at this level.â€￾The two teams crossed paths in 2004-05, as Ancelottiâ€™s men won both legs 1-0 to progress.â€œMilan have a good history here, but Manchester have matured with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo since then. They are the freshest and most potent of the four semi-finalists. Milan are more relaxed, but when I watch Kaka I always expect something wonderful to happen.â€￾Jordan is still fondly remembered by the Rossoneri fans, having made the move from Manchester United in 1981.â€œI had been earning Â£25,000 per season, but got double those wages in Milan. I accepted that challenge after having rejected offers from Bayern Munich and Ajax when I was still at Leeds United,â€￾ added â€˜Lo Squalo.â€™â€œMilan were a grand club, more prestigious than Manchester, as it was the side of Cesare Maldini, Fabio Cudicini, Gianni Rivera and Nils Liedholm.â€￾ pr22j.html","Mon Apr 23, 2007 5:54 pm",59,5953,World Football,AC Milan Thread

"Is having three clubs in the last four of the UEFA Champions League a triumph for England, or the countryâ€™s ability to attract some of the worldâ€™s best talent?With Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool still on course for Europeâ€™s most glittering prize, is this pursuit losing its lustre when these teams are made up almost entirely of foreigners?And, what role have the foreigners played in making the English Premiership, as Sir Alex Ferguson claims, â€˜the best league in the worldâ€™?Letâ€™s go back to a time when Italy, not Britannia, ruled the waves. During the late 1980s, when strict quotas kept the influx of foreign players to an absolute minimum, the Italians were masterful, helped by bucket loads of cash, much like England today, in identifying the best money could buy.Juventus won just about everything with Frenchman Michel Platini and Polish star Zbigniew Boniek. Napoli went the South American route, buying Diego Maradona, Careca and Alemao. Inter Milan developed a German edge with Lothar Matthaus, Jurgen Klinsmann and Andreas Brehme. And, AC Milan dominated Europe with the Dutch trio of Marco Van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard.In those days, a maximum three foreign players, per team were permitted in Serie A, which also meant club managers had to be shrewd and very selective with what they bought as only the very best would do, and rightly so.In Napoliâ€™s case, as Maradona mesmerised the globe with his nimble trickery, the southern club had to retain the right balance of local talent to build a team around the Argentine. The trophies that followed, two Italian league titles and a UEFA Cup, were a reflection of the overall quality of Italian football, not just Maradonaâ€™s genius.During the most recent Real Madrid golden era, which produced three European crowns between 1998 and 2002, nobody disputes the foreign contribution made by the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo, Predrag Mijatovic, Fernando Redondo or Roberto Carlos, but a considerable slice of credit also goes to the teamâ€™s large Spanish component.Nowadays, in the liberated world of the European Unionâ€™s free trade market, teams on that continent are mostly shedding their national identity in pursuit of silverware. Maybe the clubâ€™s country of origin is to blame for not producing enough star quality to stay loyal to their own. Ultimately, those with money can afford to combine the best of both worlds.The search for a foreigner more often than not leads to a big name signing, match winners like Cristiano Ronaldo, Didier Drogba, Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack.They also occupy key areas of the pitch, robbing the likes of an Alan Smith, Joe Cole or Shaun Wright-Phillips the opportunity they need to develop their game on the big stage.If, for argumentâ€™s sake, Smith, Cole and Wright-Phillips are not in favour, they end up at mid-range clubs like Everton, Middlesbrough and Tottenham. The education they receive there in competitions like the UEFA Cup is simply not the same.The potential knock-on effect this has on a national team can become a major concern, as it did in Italy when its doors swung wide open to incorporate more and more foreigners throughout the 1990s, a period they dominated. Cultured Italian players combined with the best of the rest made for a lethal cocktail of tactical and technical superiority.However, as the four-time world champion Azzurri struggled in international tournaments, many critics argued that top clubs were not promoting the countryâ€™s most promising youngsters. This is a separate issue, but one that is being addressed in the interests of restoring international football. The clubs, guided by their national associations, have a critical role to play in ensuring that happens.At the moment, the UEFA Champions League has developed in to a World Cup of sorts. Twenty six different nationalities are represented in the final four. UEFA calculated the breakdown of countries represented by including those who have played some part in tournament.For example, Australia is recognised for only having one representative, that being AC Milanâ€™s Zeljko Kalac for his three appearances, while Harry Kewell is technically part of the Liverpool squad but injury has made him unavailable thus far so he does not count according to UEFA.By the way, England possesses an alarmingly small number of players - 21 - considering three teams qualified from that country, compared with 15 players from Italy which has only one team through to the semi-final stage.England is the third country to produce three semi-finalists in the UEFA Champions League. Spain was the first, with Valencia, Barcelona and Real Madrid in 1999/2000, followed by Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Inter, in 2002/2003.Looking closely at the composition of each squad, though, only Manchester United deserves recognition for the way it represents England. Chelsea and Liverpool are the products of a system overflowing with too much cash and not enough sense. They have ignored their responsibility to England partly because a Portuguese and Spaniard run the show.Sir Alex Ferguson may be Scottish but after 20 years at Old Trafford he knows the English landscape better than anyone else. The longevity of his success in being able to regenerate the Red Devils over and over again is enough to even make Mourinho envious.United possesses a solid core of past and present English internationals including Wayne Rooney, Gary Neville, Michael Carrick, Rio Ferdinand, Alan Smith, Wes Brown and Paul Scholes. Chelsea provides John Terry, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and Shaun Wright-Phillips. Liverpool weighs in with Steven Gerrard, Peter Crouch, Stephen Warnock and Jamie Carragher.All of those mentioned might be considered solid professionals, but put them together in the same side and, as their performances for England prove, few of them make a huge difference.Using Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool as my talent pool, I have taken a team of English internationals and pitted them against a selection of foreign All Stars.England (4-3-3): No goalkeeper available; Carragher, Ferdinand, Terry, A. Cole; Gerrard, Carrick, Lampard, J. Cole, Crouch, Rooney. Manager: Nobody qualifiesForeign All Stars (4-3-3): Cech; Finnan, Carvalho, Vidic, Heinze; Xabi Alonso, Makelele, Giggs; Cristiano Ronaldo, Drogba, Shevchenko. Manager: Sir Alex FergusonI believe the foreigners would win, and maybe so will England in the long run if they can learn from them, but to say English football is now the best in Europe based on what has occurred in this seasonâ€™s UEFA Champions League would be a mistake.Ferguson claims to have the answer to this ongoing debate. He says, â€œThe Premiership is the best league in the world. These things go in cycles. English clubs dominated in the 1980s, the Italians were fantastic in the 1990s and the Spanish in the early 2000s.â€￾â€œThey had three teams in the semi-final one year, so they were the best in Europe at that point. But, gradually, the English clubs have gone above that. The form of Barcelona and Real Madrid this season has not been up to their usual standard anyway, and the English clubs have moved ahead.â€￾The problem for me is that outside the top four teams in England, I find it hard to appreciate the overall standard of the Premier League. In Spain, however, at least half the teams are more than competitive and mostly enjoyable to watch.You only need to look at Osasuna and Espanyol, two of the three Spanish teams, along with Sevilla, through to the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup. They are sitting mid-table or lower at present in La Liga.The UEFA Cup exposes the continentâ€™s second tier clubs, providing a fairly accurate indication of which country currently boasts the best football right across the board. Spain has won that race in 2007.English clubs may be thriving at the top end of town in the UEFA Champions League, but I look at what lies beneath the surface. And, if you remove that sexy foreign accent, ask yourself this, â€˜what would be left to admire?â€™.If the same foreign quota that regulated European club football 20 years ago was still in effect, I think English club football, like the countryâ€™s national team, would have been left in the wilderness.","Wed Apr 18, 2007 11:16 am",1,356,World Football,England's sexy accent - Andrew Orsatti

Tuesday 20 March, 2007 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Milan transfer guru Adriano Galliani has reiterated that they are in â€œsuper pole positionâ€￾ for Ronaldinho, but Gianluca Zambrotta could be included in the huge deal.The Rossoneri have repeatedly stated this season that if the 2005 Ballon dâ€™Or winner should go for a change of scenery, there would be only one option.â€œI donâ€™t think that Barcelona will let Ronaldinho go, but if they do decide to sell, he will certainly come to Milan and not any other club,â€￾ stated Galliani this evening at the â€˜Milan Business Forumâ€™.â€œWe are in super pole position for the player and President Silvio Berlusconi will not hold back in his attempts to sign Ronaldinho.â€￾The Brazilianâ€™s links with Milan â€“ complete with Kaka, Ronaldo and Ricardo Oliveira publicly calling for his move â€“ are nothing new, but there are developments.According to the â€˜Gazzetta dello Sportâ€™, Barcelona could be tempted by a huge transfer swoop for Ronaldinho and teammate Zambrotta.The former Juventus full-back was all set to join the San Siro giants after the World Cup, but told the media he was pushed into choosing an overseas option following the Calciopoli demotion.He has found life difficult at the Nou Camp and told another Italian magazine this week that the future is not in La Liga.â€œIt is my dream to end my career in Italy,â€￾ said Zambrotta in â€˜Chiâ€™. â€œBarcelona are my favourite foreign club, but in Italy I really like Milan.

"At first the points in common are evident in terms of the fact weâ€™re talking about three players whose height was almost always cited as an obstacle to be overcome. Maradona stands 1.66m in his Albiceleste socks, RomÃ¡rio â€“ nicknamed â€˜O Baixinhoâ€™ (Shorty) â€“ is three centimetres taller than â€˜Diosâ€™ (God) at 1.69m â€“ exactly the same height as Lionel Messi.Fair enough, so none of them were going to be basketball players, but what of it? Those who claim that their height-wise shortcomings forced a certain idiosyncratic flair out of them wouldnâ€™t be wrong either. To compete with their more corpulent peers all three forged their diminutive statures from weaknesses into weapons â€“ although there are those who opine that the lower centre of gravity gave them a natural edge above lankier players.Thereâ€™s also another common thread that could be seen as a causative factor in their growth â€“ or lack of it. Both Maradona and RomÃ¡rio hail from humble backgrounds in shanty towns / slums, the same breeding grounds that have seen some of the brassiest footballing talents in the world come from the muck of extreme poverty.RomÃ¡rio was born near, yet so far, from the sun-kissed Rio de Janeiro shores he adores so much, the son of Edevair de Souza Faria and Manuela Ladislau Faria living in the Jacarezinho (Little Alligator) favela. Poverty-stricken, the future starâ€™s family had problems feeding the youngster and he grew at a slow rate.Diego Armando Maradona was born in run-down Villa Fiorito, a dirt poor district on the southern fringes of Buenos Aires to a poor family that had moved from Corrientes Province. The oldest of three brothers â€“ who also went into football, albeit with far less success â€“ also found his development stunted by a lack of food.At the age of 11, Messi was diagnosed with a hormone deficiency that stunted his growth â€“ and would have stunted it even further had FC Barcelona not offered to pay for an expensive treatment that his poor family couldnâ€™t afford. Apart from the physical aspects, all three have a point in common in a ball control that leaves the sphere apparently glued onto their boots. This has wound three generations of defenders and holding midfielders up to breaking points as it combines with their size very well.All three are capable of holding the ball up effectively with their back to a rival â€“ or several â€“ until support arrives, or to burn time in the last minutes of a game thatâ€™s got a favourable result. The low centre of gravity means theyâ€™re harder to nudge over than a taller player, sticking over the ball with limpet-like firmness near a sideline until they pass the ball or get fouled.The shorter legs are also a boon to manoeuvring in small spaces. Like a Mini Cooper compared to a Ford Mustang, the turning circle is so much smaller that gaps that appear impossible for the larger are easy to fit into for the smaller. Try watching â€˜The Italian Jobâ€™ (either version) and â€˜Bullitâ€™ to get an idea if the metaphor fails to convince.All three attracted defenders like a flame attracts moths, sometimes drawing up to three or four exasperated rivals out of their teamâ€™s tactical shape. This would, at its best, be followed by a sudden â€˜handbrake turnâ€™ as the diminutive marvels shot out of the â€˜scrumâ€™.The RomÃ¡rio comparison is lessened given the fact that out of the illustrious trio heâ€™s the sole right-footer, although there is a doppelganger similarity to some Messi moves in his killer instinct in the box and opportunism.Examples of moves that enchant spectators litter the careers of the retired â€˜Diosâ€™, the about-to-retire â€˜Baixinhoâ€™ and the nowhere-near-retiring â€˜Pulgaâ€™ (Messi being nicknamed the â€˜Fleaâ€™ for self-evident reasons) and linger in the memory with barely-restrained fondness, an aching longing and great memories that Messi is now resurrecting for CulÃ©s all over the world.They also all had seminal performances against the Merengues that are still recalled by those fortunate to have seen them first hand â€“ and even those who saw them for the first time years afterwards. Although Maradonaâ€™s time at Barcelona was short-lived, his performance at the BernabÃ©u â€“ dribbling several defenders down the flank before scoring in 1983 â€“ brought a standing ovation only repeated years later for Ronaldinho. People still marvel at his 'rabona' move in which a shot, pass or cross is performed by moving the playing leg behind the weight-bearing leg and kicking the ball forwards with the first with the player's legs crossed. It's since been used by many players, notable Barcelona examples being Rivaldo - and RomÃ¡rio.RomÃ¡rioâ€™s hat-trick against Real Madrid during the â€˜manitaâ€™ (five-goal drubbing) inflicted by Cruyffâ€™s BarÃ§a on Benito Floroâ€™s Merengues is also a moment that has become immortalised in Blaugrana memories, particularly the â€˜cola de vacaâ€™ (cowâ€™s tail) move that saw him sweep the ball around Alkorta and score.Now itâ€™s Messiâ€™s turn to be forged into a consecrated idol after being the heart and soul of Barcelona against their white nemesis. His hat-trick may not have been the jewel in the crown of a win, but the fact that he equalised no less than three times is almost as good.His performance in the BarÃ§a-Real Madrid ClÃ¡sico ended with the final strike stroked past Casillas in the 90th minute, denying Capelloâ€™s Madrid three points that would have re-ignited their spluttering attempt to revive a Liga title challenge and sink Rijkaardâ€™s side at the same time.Argentinean sports daily â€˜OlÃ©â€™ made no bones about their view of how Messi performed and who it reminded Argentine observers of: â€œMessi is a clone of Maradonaâ€¦â€™What planet is he from?â€™â€￾, the last part echoing football pundit VÃ­ctor Hugo Morales who used the same phrase to describe Diego Armando Maradona during Mexico 1986 as a â€œbarrilete cÃ³smicoâ€￾ (cosmic kite) after his showing against England.With Maradona himself having broadcast his own opinion far and wide, thereâ€™s little doubt that the mythical number 10 sees Messi as his heir. Messi himself knows this and responds with wisdom. â€œDiego is the greatestâ€¦as alwaysâ€￾, Messi underlined. â€œThe only thing that I can do is to continue working, continue improvingâ€¦but not so that I can make the comparison clearer. Iâ€™m here to carry on learning and evolving and weâ€™ll see what I can do.â€￾In Spanish thereâ€™s a saying that comparisons are always hateable. Being compared to Messi and RomÃ¡rio is clearly a compliment for any player, but perhaps we are in danger of looking to the past to find explanations for present gloryâ€¦.and to anticipate future paths when they still remain to be walked.Itâ€™s a natural vice, but nevertheless a vice, which brings us to the last point of comparison â€“contrast. Maradonaâ€™s slide into cocaine addiction and his turbulent private life, RomÃ¡rioâ€™s avoidance of training and sex obsession: plus the fact that they both spent a short time at Barcelona.Messi has so far steered clear of any mention of a troubled personality and his interviews reveal a relaxed, humble young man rather than a player with something to prove or a chip on their shoulder resulting in the growth of a super-ego. His only â€˜scandalâ€™ has been to be present â€“ not involved â€“ at a Rosario bar argument that didnâ€™t even end in a brawl. Itâ€™s hardly the sort of behaviour that stands comparison with either RomÃ¡rio or Maradona; even at their most angelic.In time terms Maradona and RomÃ¡rio â€“ Ronaldo too â€“ spent stunted stints at Camp Nou, although they perhaps burned themselves into memories precisely because they did so much to remember in such a short space of time. â€˜Diosâ€™ may have found his time with the Catalans hampered by hepatitis and an ankle-shattering tackle by â€˜Butcher of Bilbaoâ€™ Andoni Goikoetxea, but shone so brightly we need to wear sunglasses over two decades later: 38 goals in 58 games is still a statistic thatâ€™s hard to match.â€˜O Baixinhoâ€™, perhaps one of the few to be able to compete with (or better) such scoring proficiency, like Ronaldo after him, came from PSV and exploded with 34 goals in 46 games, arriving and leaving almost exactly two decades after Maradona.Messi arrived, unlike the others, as a pearl to be cultured in Catalunya rather than a star whoâ€™d already proved their worth in gold â€“ and arrived at Camp Nou on the backs of big transfers: a (then) record-breaking $10 million for the Argentine, â€˜onlyâ€™ $4 million for the Brazilian as PSV saw him as equally talented as truancy-prone. Leo has been nurtured at La MasÃ­a (The Mansion), Barcelonaâ€™s residential youth academy, rather than being a formed import that just needed slotting into the first team. Heâ€™s a different case to both Maradona and RomÃ¡rio for a number of reasons, and similar in other aspects, but still a young man whoâ€™s continuing to develop and grow both on and off the pitch.We will continue to compare â€“ itâ€™s a human failing, this sentimentality, but who on earth would want to rob football of its sentiments? We love our teams with a passion that is almost as undying as it is inexplicable, an almost religious faith, and, just as passion is intimately related to love, we take joy from the comparisons of current stars to the ones of yesteryear.Messi may have aspects of Maradona and RomÃ¡rio in aspects of his game, but heâ€™s far from being a simple blend of eitherâ€¦or even a hybrid with other idols thrown into the blender to produce â€˜formula Messiâ€™. Our comparisons of past with present players arenâ€™t hateful â€“ far from it â€“ but they wonâ€™t bring us closer to the truth which is that Lionel Messi has just started. Perhaps the best move is to just enjoy a player who will doubtless lead us to compare future players with a â€œYou know, that player really reminds me of Lionel Messiâ€¦â€￾","Thu Mar 15, 2007 5:24 pm",0,334,World Football,Barcelona Alchemy

"Interesting and slightly amusing article from the Times Online. Would probably be much the same experience for an Adelaide United players if they tried:THE MILLWALL striker, Darren Byfield, has attempted to close the vast gulf that exists between footballers and fans by logging on to the supportersâ€™ independent website, MillwallOnline, and trying to engage people in rational, good-humoured conversation. It is a story worth telling for the sheer nobility of the enterprise and its, erm, predictable outcome.Byfield posted a message under the name of â€œbabyboyâ€￾ (the endearment used, apparently, by his girlfriend Jamelia). â€œDarren Byfield here,â€￾ he wrote. â€œFire some questions.â€￾ The first two he received were: â€œWhy does it always rain on me?â€￾ and â€œExplain the theory of relativity, please.â€￾ Then there were one or two about Jamelia and the stuff she does, or doesnâ€™t do and which I canâ€™t really go into here. But the lad was undaunted. No, he said, ask me stuff about Millwall. But the trouble is, nobody really believed it was Darren Byfield and so the remainder of the questions concerned ways that the striker could prove that he was who he said he was, questions that made him increasingly exasperated.Eventually it was agreed that before the start of a game against Blackpool he would run up and kick the post twice, as a signal that it was indeed He. Sure enough, just before kick-off, Byfield trotted all the way back from the centre circle and kicked the post twice, beaming at the Millwall supporters. So it was him! And then someone pointed out that Byfield always kicks the post twice before the start of a game; itâ€™s a superstition of his. So we were back where we started. Eventually the poor chap had to ring a local paper and explain that it wasnâ€™t a wind-up, it really was Darren Byfield talking to the fans, please believe me now, etc. Even then, the story was still doubted.Heâ€™d taken a fair amount of stick on the message boards, long before he logged on. He was accused of playing with a most unMillwall like languor, with a disinterested expression on his face. On one occasion, before Christmas, as he disdained to chase down a loose ball from a corner, a friend of mine shouted out, rather harshly: â€œItâ€™s okay, Byfield, feel free to join in at any time.â€￾ Byfield, with some justification, put this perceived indifference down to his having just returned from a serious injury. But then there were the press reports about him wanting, with increasing desperation, to move to a club in the midlands â€” before clamouring to move to Swansea. Someone give that man a rail ticket and an atlas, we all thought.But matched against this is the unequivocal fact that he is by far and away the most talented player Millwall possess and that if it wasnâ€™t for his 13 goals (and Richard Shawâ€™s excellence in defence), weâ€™d be still in the bottom four, rather than casting an ill-advisedly optimistic eye at the playoffs. Byfield, we all know, could play at a rather higher level.And then, after the Byfield business, someone else came on the message board using the name â€œCherryZ1â€￾ and claiming to be our goalkeeper, Lenny Pidgeley. Again, he wasnâ€™t believed. Is there anything I can do on the pitch, something unique or highly unusual, that would convince you all that I am Lenny Pidgeley, he asked. Yes, came one reply, you could catch the ******* ball for once, you useless ****. And then kick it somewhere on the pitch, rather than into touch, added another correspondent. There was then a short debate about whether this would prove conclusively that it was Lenny Pidgeley, or if it would prove conclusively that it wasnâ€™t.CherryZ1 hasnâ€™t been back, anyhow - and I sort of hope it wasnâ€™t Lenny (although Iâ€™ve been told on fairly good authority that it was).Byfieldâ€™s decision to engage with the fans was, I reckon, a brave and democratic act, to be wholeheartedly commended. He answered all of the sensible questions - even the fairly hostile ones - with great grace and without whining. But I do wonder a little quite what he expected the reaction to be.The mistake people make about our celebrity culture is that the public is somehow in awe of the celebrities. That because they earn vast sums of money and appear on television all the time we must look up to them and respect their achievements. But in my experience, there is no awe at all, just a general murmur of amusement which is sometimes good-natured and sometimes rather less so. Their job is to entertain us - and thatâ€™s about it.Certainly, that is the way we view our footballers down at The Den; we will cheer them and encourage them and, on rare occasions, afford them a standing ovation. But we are not possessed of the notion that they are Nietszchean supermen, set apart from the rest of us by their extraordinary talent. You canâ€™t think that if youâ€™re Millwall and sitting halfway up the Division One table, having recently lost 5-2 at home to Leyton Orient. But I donâ€™t think it would change very much if, through some bizarre accumulation of propitious circumstances, we were suddenly poised to claim a Champions League place, either. We would have the same exquisite lack of deference to the people whose extravagant wages we pay. We would like them, but only up to a point. It is not primarily the players to whom we owe our allegiance.So, itâ€™s nothing personal, Darren - and it was nice of you to try. But the reaction would be exactly the same if Cristiano Ronaldo signed for Millwall and decided to visit the message boards to engage with the supporters. Actually, it would be a lot worse, if weâ€™re honest.Flouncing, diving, pouting little moppet.

"This match pits two clubs with very different aims against each other.When: Saturday March 3, 20:30 (CET)Where: Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, Milan, ItalyBACKGROUND Despite the scoreless draw away to Palermo on Wednesday, Milan are still quite confident of being able to obtain one of the Champions League qualification, which would come with a fourth place or better finish.  In the aforementioned match, they dominated the play in the first half, and if not for the missed penalty by KakÃ  inside of ten minutes, they most likely would have won the full allotment of points. Probably because of the penalty miss, KakÃ  was like a demon possessed, and took on every defender in sight, with a fair amount of success, highlighted by his nutmeg of a Palermo defender.  The front line and midfield had to make up for the lack of defensive options, as Milan were without eight defenders listed on the club roster. In fact, they fielded defensive midfielder Cristian Brocchi as a makeshift right fullback. Still, they were able to keep a talented Palermo frontline from scoring.  Chievo Verona are also facing the prospect of achieving the goal they currently have set for themselves, which is to avoid relegation. A mere three points separate the Flying Donkeys from the drop zone, and they must continue the good run of form they have recently experienced.  A 3-0 steamrolling of Torino and the 2-2 draw against Roma (both at home) can give them confidence in taking their show on the road and earning some points. CURRENT FORM Milan (W W D, 37 points, 6th place in Serie A) The Rossoneri are on a run of form right now that can only be bested by their city rivals, Inter Milan, who up until Wednesday had won seventeen straight matches. Milan have not lost since November, and they will again field a 4-4-1-1 formation because of the lack of defensive cover. Chievo (D W D, 23 points, 15th place in Serie A) The Gialloblu have begun to put together some good results, and must continue to do so in order to avoid the drop. As they are one of the few sides near the bottom of the table who could be described as â€œto good to go downâ€￾, they must now prove it.  TEAM NEWS Milan have a whoâ€™s who list of Serie A players currently out of the lineup. Names such as Paolo Maldini, Filippo Inzaghi, Alessandro Nesta, Marcos Cafu, and Alessandro Costacurta will be watching from the stands. They are joined by Serginho, Kakhaber Kaladze, and possibly Massimo Ambrosini.  Chievo have major absences, too. Victor Obinna and Federico Cossato are missing from the frontline, while midfielders Luciano and Cesar Prates, along with goalkeeper Vincenzo Sicignano, join them on the training table. The biggest absentees, however, are the suspended duo of Erjon Bogdani and Fabio Moro.  PLAYERS TO WATCH Ronaldo (Milan) â€“ Because he is cup-tied and cannot be used in the Champions League, he will definitely play from the start in this match, and with the support of KakÃ , should be able to continue to find the form which earned him the nickname â€˜Il Fenomenoâ€™. Sergio Pellissier (Chievo) â€“ This tiny Italian with a French name always performs well against Milan, and has terrorized their defense in recent seasons with his ability to make timely runs. In being able to play versus a thin backline for Milan, he should get several good scoring chances.  POSSIBLE STARTING XIâ€™s Milan (4-4-1-1): Dida; Oddo, Simic, Bonera, Jankulovski; Gattuso, Brocchi, Pirlo, Seedorf; KakÃ ; Ronaldo Chievo (4-3-1-2): Squizzi; Malago, Mandelli, Dâ€™Anna, Lanna; Sammarco, Italiano, Brighi; Semioli; Pellissier, Cozzolino  PREDICTION This is sure to be an affair full of quality midfield play and good runs by the strikers. In saying that, I donâ€™t believe the goals will flow, and a low scoreline is to be expected.  Milan 1-0 Chievo","Sat Mar 03, 2007 4:19 pm",0,221,World Football,Serie A Preview
"Ronaldinho has distanced himself from a Milan move. â€œIâ€™m convinced that Iâ€™ll remain at Barcelona for some time yet,â€￾ he declared.The Italian giants have been fuelling rumours of a summer move for the sensation after President Silvio Berlusconi, Vice-President Adriano Galliani and director general Ariedo Braida all confirmed he is a target.However, the player himself has seemingly shot down the possibility that he could be joining countrymen Ronaldo and Kaka at the San Siro next term.â€œThe more time passes, the more Iâ€™m convinced that I will stay at Barcelona for many more years,â€￾ the former Paris SG ace noted. â€œIâ€™m happy here.â€￾The South American has undeniably had a difficult campaign at the Nou Camp with rumours of unrest in the Barca squad.After being blasted by teammate Samuel Etoâ€™o during the latter's recent verbal outbursts, the Spanish media then attached a â€˜Gordoâ€™ tag to him after claims that he was overweight.But Ronaldinho, 16 goals in La Liga this term, has silenced his critics with some awesome displays for the European giants recently.â€œIâ€™ve had a difficult week because of those photographs which appeared to show that I was overweight,â€￾ he added.â€œIt was a tough situation for me, with people telling me that I needed to eat less.

"It will be a race to the finish this Saturday in a town known for horse racing.When: Saturday February 17, 15:00 (CET)Where: Stadio Artemio Franchi, Siena, ItalyBACKGROUND The town of Siena, highly regarded around the world for its yearly horse race, the Palio, will get a brief view of some thoroughbreds from Milan, by way of Brazil. The Rossoneri attack should be something special to witness, with three Brazilians storming the Siena goal. This attacking trio is KakÃ , Ricardo Oliveira, and Ronaldo. So often this season, KakÃ  has been seemingly alone in creating the scoring opportunities, and has been forced to hit almost impossible shots from distance, due to the lack of movement up front from his strikers. This should no longer be a problem, however. KakÃ  will pull the strings and attempt to provide Ronaldo with adequate service, with Oliveira serving as support to both players in the attacking movements. Oliveira himself had struggled so far this term, but the addition of Ronaldo will make him feel a little more at home, and he should begin to play better. Ronaldo is not yet up to full fitness, but getting the start in this match will be enough motivation for him to continue working toward full fitness. The Siena goal they will be attempting to set afire will be manned by Alex Manninger, and he spoke of the significance of this match, saying: â€œPlaying against Milan is unique because we will play against one of the three or four most powerful teams in the world. Itâ€™s an honor to play a game like this. We have always played good games against the Rossoneri and we will hope to gain some points on Saturday as well. Ronie (in reference to Ronaldo) is the kind of player that can make things difficult at any moment.â€￾  Manningerâ€™s words may well ring true on Saturday, especially given his sideâ€™s defensive record. The Bianconeri defense has given up the same number of goals in their home stadium as they have scored, which is twelve. The Siena net minder has seen his team draw at home more often than any other result obtained, and they will be lucky to get that this weekend.  CURRENT FORM Siena (W L D, 25 points, 12th place in Serie A) Despite their inability to win matches this term, Siena find themselves in mid-table placing, by virtue of drawing half of the twenty-two matches played so far this season. The winter addition of Massimo Maccarone from Middlesbrough in the transfer market will help get the side more victories, especially if he can mesh well with Mario Frick, who is the sideâ€™s leading scorer with six goals.  Milan (D W W, 30 points, 7th place in Serie A) The Rossoneri have not lost since November, and are improving constantly. This match will not see a full first team squad, as several players will not be fielded in view of the Champions League match in Scotland against Celtic on Tuesday. Nevertheless, the Milan midfield and attack should be able to control most of the possession.  TEAM NEWS Siena is missing Abdoulay Konko, who is out with a knee injury. Enrico Chiesa is battling the flue, but may be able to play. Mario Frick had a dental procedure carried out during the week, but he should be fine to play in this match.  Milan, yet again, have a long list of injuries. Alessandro Nesta, Serginho, Giuseppe Favalli are missing from the backline, with Cristian Brocchi and Clarence Seedorf being doubts in the midfield. Also, Nelson Dida will not be in goal, but Marco Storari showed himself to be a good replacement between the posts in his debut last weekend.  PLAYERS TO WATCH Massimo Maccarone (Siena) â€“ He will be relied upon heavily in this match, as he will need to do a lot of the attacking work on his own up front. However, he will be going against a Milan defense which has been pieced together, so he could well get a goal or two. Ronaldo (Milan) â€“ He looked lively in his debut last Sunday when coming on as a substitute, and almost scored from distance. Getting to play from the first kick will give him a better chance to become involved in the rhythm or even dictate it himself. If that rhythm just so happens to resemble the samba, then he could set alight the Siena nets.  POSSIBLE STARTING XIâ€™s Siena (4-3-1-2): Manninger; Bertotto, Portanova, Rinaudo, Molinaro; Antonini, Codrea, Vergassola; Cozza; Frick, Maccarone Milan (4-3-1-2): Storari; Oddo, Bonera, Kaladze, Jankulovski; Gattuso, Pirlo, Gourcuff; KakÃ ; Oliveira, Ronaldo PREDICTION This match will be full of scoring chances for Milan, despite the trio of KakÃ , Ronaldo, and Oliveira not having too much experience together. Siena will be on their heels most of the time, but the ability they have to grind out results should keep this as a low scoring affair.  Siena 0-2 Milan","Sat Feb 17, 2007 7:30 pm",16,2609,World Football,Serie A Preview

"Heerenveen centre-forward Afonso Alves, a relative unknown even back in his native Brazil, is topping the European scoring charts with a monstrous efficiency in front of goal. Being touted, surprise, as â€˜The new Van Nistelrooyâ€￾, the 26 year-old player has scored 22 goals in 23 games so far this season, bettering the statistics of such consecrated idols as Didier Drogba and Cristiano Ronaldo.This is even true when statistical weighting is taken into account due to the easier nature of the Eredivisie compared to the EPL and other European competitions. The actual top scorer without the weighting would be Gruznov, 31 goals scored â€“ albeit in the not-very-tough Estonian league.Afonso Alves started his career with AtlÃ©tico Mineiro. In 2002 he crossed the pond to Europe and modest Swedish outfit Ã–rgryte IS. His performances earned him a 2004 transfer to MalmÃ¶ FF, winning the Swedish League in 2004 and coming second scorer on occasions.Half way through the 2006 season he swapped MalmÃ¶ for pastures new and Dutch side Heerenveen. Known for his large feet, he is a talented free-kick taker. According to the Heerenveen Coach, every goal Alves scores adds a million to his price.

I believe he is a really important player and will be able to help the team thanks to his desire to play for Milan.â€￾Gilardino mirrored his Coachâ€™s views and accepted that the Giallorossiâ€™s goal just after the interval was deadly.â€œWe played well in the first half even though we were a goal down, but their goal early in the second half was too much for us,â€￾ noted the striker.â€œWe did well, both from a mental and physical point of view. Itâ€™s a pity we didnâ€™t manage to score another goal in the first half.â€œNow we must focus on the next match at Ascoli.

"Moratti: No ref assistance Inter chief Massimo Moratti has shot down accusations that his outfit are being favoured by referees. â€œI donâ€™t think we are being helped,â€￾ he assured.The Nerazzurri netted their 13th straight win on Sunday in controversial circumstances after Fiorentina questioned the performance of referee Emidio Morganti.â€œI honestly donâ€™t think the referees are favouring us, but this kind of statement helps those who need excuses when they lose,â€￾ said the oil tycoon.â€œThe controversy was caused by what Fiorentinaâ€™s Coach [Cesare Prandelli] and sporting director [Pantaleo Corvino] said after the match. â€œFrom a certain point of view I think they were nervous when they saw what they later described to the Press. â€œDuring the match the referee didnâ€™t give me the same impression they had. We are used to hearing these kind of things, itâ€™s become a kind of habitâ€¦â€￾Inter have stretched their lead at the top of the table to 11 points over Roma, but Moratti wants his men to focus.â€œWe are still competing, mainly with Roma who are an important team,â€￾ added the President.â€œWe still havenâ€™t won anything. Fortunately we are doing well, but besides this we donâ€™t think we have already won.â€￾Moratti had stated on Monday that he would consider Ronaldoâ€™s arrival at Milan a sort of betrayal, but insists that he will do nothing to stop the transfer.â€œWould it be hard to see Ronaldo at Milan? We would have to live with it. In any case I want to reiterate that we will do nothing to cause the transfer to fail,â€￾ concluded Moratti.In the meantime, reports suggest that the Nerazzurri are ready to offer Antonio Cassano a four-year-contract at the end of the season.The Bari-born striker is set to leave Real Madrid and was recently paired with Inter, after boss Roberto Mancini stated that he would be happy to have him at his disposal.The former Roma man has allegedly agreed to the summer move, when he may pen a Â£2.8m per year deal.","Wed Jan 24, 2007 9:36 pm",3,361,World Football,Moratti

"Inter chief Massimo Moratti has admitted that he could make a bid for Antonio Cassano this summer.The Real Madrid striker has been linked with the Nerazzurri after Coach Roberto Mancini declared that he would welcome the addition of the Bari-born player.â€œWe are not interested in making any new signings and I think that the win over Fiorentina proved that we are fine just as we are,â€￾ said the President in an interview to Il Corriere dello Sport.â€œWe are not making any plans for him now, but Cassano is included in a list of 10 players that we are targeting.â€œWe will keep on following them until June, when we will understand the Coachâ€™s needs,â€￾ added the oil tycoon.Moratti then commented on the news suggesting that Ronaldo is close to returning to the San Siro with city rivals Milan, a transfer which the chief would consider a betrayal.â€œIn August we contacted the player, but the move didnâ€™t go through. We would not be happy if he joined Milan and he cannot expect us to react differently.â€œHis transfer to the Rossoneri would be a betrayal, but I prefer to wait until the deal is finalised before making any other comments.â€￾The Nerazzurro then stated that he is not worried about the fact that Mancini has yet to renew his contract.â€œI hope there are no doubts left, we are both very serene. We have always had an excellent relationship in the past and I am sure this will continue,â€￾ concluded Moratti.Technical director Marco Branca agrees with his President on Ronaldoâ€™s probable move to Milan.â€œIt is against nature,â€￾ he insisted. â€œWe have lived many intense moments with him and he did a lot for us.

"The four big names on the list are Eric Abidal (Olympique Lyon-FRA, FRA), Xabi Alonso (Liverpool-ENG, SPA) Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United-ENG, POR) and Rodrigo Palacio (Boca Juniors-ARG, ARG), adding up to one key reinforcement for each field line.Abidal has already commented on rumours of Blaugrana interest positively; â€œyou canâ€™t say no to a club like BarÃ§aâ€￾, he told Spanish sports paper â€˜El Mundo Deportivoâ€™. The 27 year-old is seen as an ideal player to compensate for the imminent twilight of thirty-somethings Sylvinho & Gio and has refused to extent his Lyon contract so far with an eye on Camp Nou.This seems like the more straightforward signings of the four mooted arrivals with the other three depending on crunch issues. Ronaldo already had his fingers toasted after flirting with Real Madrid in the summer but has recovered idol status at old Trafford thanks to his blistering form in the last part of 2006. As the Merengues have already made their moves the player may well be amenable to a move to Catalunya. The problem is that the forward will have to make yet another bid for freedom knowing that if things donâ€™t pan out well heâ€™ll be seen as little more than a mercenary by Red Devils fans.Xabi Alonso was a Barcelona target before he moved to Anfield from Anoeta and the ex-Real Sociedad man could make a return to Spanish football after his successful stint in the Premiership. The problem, once again, is that the player will have to ask to leave before BarÃ§a make an approach and, as of now, that seems unlikely.Palacio has already been approached via current club Boca Juniors, but Mauricio Macri has already rejected an initial bid of 18 million Euros for the 24 year-old goalgetter. Seen as somewhat of an alternative to Cristiano Ronaldo for his seeping wing play and marksmanship, Palacio is a hard target after Boca sold Gago.A fifth potential target would be Frank Lampard, who may well be up for grabs if Chelsea win the Champions League this year. The player is apparently keen to play at Camp Nou (his partner is Catalan) and may be allowed to leave after the Champions League for the right price as a type of bonus for services rendered to the Blues.","Wed Jan 03, 2007 8:48 am",10,914,World Football,BarÃ§a Prepare 2007 Signings

"Goal.com Calcio Addicts Corner: Italyâ€™s ApologeticQuite recently I have received many emails of what Blatter, the head of FIFA, said. After reading these emails and researching the issue of contention, I felt compelled to write an apologetic. What is an apologetic, many of you say? Well it is the opposite of a polemic, which many Azzurri haters are doing right now -insulting Italy. Well now the time has come for Darth Vader to meet Luke Skywalker yet again. No, I wish not to write about this issue for I am a fan of many national teams. However, when I see a blatant lack of respect among journalists about Italy and the barrages of insults I have received that Italy sucks (put in the politest sense) and furthermore, since I write for the Italian section in addition to many other writers muzzling themselves on this issue, I feel compelled to step up to the plate. Perhaps it is a ploy from my editor to get me to write about this as the other lads have not. I would have use the other title the case for Italy, but Gabriele Marcotti took that away form me. To the astute football fan, he was the man who wrote the article when Italy was criticized over playing defensive football and was written about 6-7 years ago. As we now know, Italy put the defense stigma behind them, so let us now focus on the apologetic.Blatter the head of FIFA, to some is seen as a great man promoting fair play, racial equality and trying to make FIFA attain a far greater scope than the United Nations as the world loves football. On the other hand, he is seen as a scoundrel, corrupt, power hungry and a man who plays favorites. After all, 4 years ago he was accused of being corrupt and he seems to favour national sides. According to some journalists, he never liked the Italian Federation and to punish them he told the officials to let South Korea go through (just look 4 years later, hey went home in the first round). Am I for conspiracy theories? No, but the officiating was biased in 2002. On the other hand, the Azzurri should have beaten South Korea. To some conspiracy reporters, he made a deal with Platini that France was to win the World Cup and Cannavaro would receive the best player of the tournament. However, it did not go according to plan as Italy came to play and showed their perseverance and nerves in the dreaded penalties. Therefore, to appease France, Zidane was awarded best players and as a sign of his enmity towards Italy, he did not hand then the trophy at the festivities. His number two did.Aside from the conspiracy theories, let us focus on what he said. Italy did not deserve to win the World Cup for the penalty against Australia should have never been awarded. Australia deserved to progress to the next round. Well well well, looked at what the cat dragged in.Firstly, did he apologize ever to the Italian Federation for 2002? 2) Is the notion the divine right of Kings still exist in the upper echelons of FIFA?  Since when does a team deserve to win a World Cup? A team plays to win and by that notion victory should come. Not by divine right or we are this country and so forth.Now let us focus on the Azzurri. If we look at past International tournaments, Lippiâ€™s boys were comfortable in playing the game and confident. Not since Italia 90 and Zoffâ€™s Euro 2000 squad were they ever comfortable. In past tournaments they seemed apprehensive and afraid to move the ball scared of their own shadow.  Lippi got them out of the shell completely and fully implemented the Zoff project of playing attacking free flowing football, along with being a united cohesive unit not forgetting that defense also wins championships. The plan went into full motion when their first real test was against Van Bastsnâ€™s Holland. Lippi stated clearly â€œwe are coming for victory and not to expect a Euro 2000 game. The critics laughed. On the other hand, as the saying goes, he who laughs first laughs last. Holland opened the scoring and Italy had a goal disallowed. But it did not stop them. Instead of retreating into a defensive shell, or not showing up for a friendly, the Azzurri gave a lesson in total football as they took control over the game. The impotent strike force was on Viagra and the Dutch defense could not stop a rampant Italy who took control over all areas of the game. Van Bastenâ€™s undefeated streak ended and the Rotterdam crowd was silenced. Clearly, this was a brand new Azzurri side and they took no prisoners. The signal was given. We are Italy and respect us. Italy marched on and gave Germany a 4-1 defeat in Florence.Lippi had his plans. He wanted to defeat Brazil in a final and bring the cup to Rome. However, the scandal then plagued Italy and what seemed as a team that was fully capable of winning it, would go home early. The pundits changed the odds. On the other hand, Lippi got a team of egocentric stars and did a Capello. â€œI am the coach we all are in this together and live with it or go home.â€￾ Del Piero and Totti were not happy, but they wanted a chance at glory.And that they did. They defeated a pesky Ghana and after the US debacle, they showed up and defeated the Czech Republic. The goaltending was superb, the defense was alert and they pushed forward.Against Australia, Italy had full control of the first half and it could have been 2-0 at half time. Then in the second half Materazzi was red carded for no reason and Italy retreated but Australia rarely threatened. Marcello unleashed his secret weapon: Totti. As the game progressed it was clear the Aussies had trouble containing his fluid passes. His passes eventually went to Grosso and yes there was contact, hence a foul. Even if there was no foul, he was unmarked, away from the defender and he was in a great position to score or to pass it to other players.Now the Quarterfinal. Italy dominated from start to finish. It was clear from 6 minutes on Lippiâ€™s men would not take prisoners. Yes the Ukraine was unlucky, but they paid dearly for Italy were clinical cerebral assassins on the other end. Anything you can do we can do better. And so they did. Plus Toni was at his best. Against Germany they had to beat the favorite team who never lost in that stadium for over 70 years on their home soil. They played the better first half as the Germans could not contain the flanks. They faltered in the second half, but in extra time the Azzurri threw everything they had at them and the notion of defense was thrown out. Germany played with fire and lost.  Both teams gave a semifinal to remember and in the end, Italy got the result and off to Berlin.  Not worthy to play in a final Blatter?Now the final. Italy dominated the first half and after a blatant dive from Malouda which should have been a red card, France scored on a penalty. However, they marched on and les bleus had no response to Zambrottaâ€™s runs and Pirloâ€™s dead ball situations. Hence, they scored and nearly scored again. In essence, the game should have never gone into extra time as Italy could have won 1-0. However, it did and it will forever be remembered for the head butt incident in which FIFA was clearly biased in awarding punishment and for the shoot out which saw Trezeguet become the new Baggio. Yes, Italy won on a razor thins edge, but Barthez could not stop any penalty.Yes, Italy played with fire, but they won and if you are a frugal person they gave you drama and all the bang for the buck. After all, they made one see 120 plus minutes of soccer. What more could one ask for?In the end who deserved to win it? England, Brazil, Argentina? Argentina blew it against Germany, Brazil was not the team and Germany would have beat them, England was well not there and France was just fortunate also as Spain self destructed and Portugal did not push forward fully enough and with coordination.Oh yeah since we must apologize. Blatter should say sorry to Croatia as they were handed dubious decisions against Australia and to England as Ronaldo seemed to know what he was doing to anger Rooney. Plus he can apologize to the fans for the Portugal, Netherlands game where in my opinion both teams should have been kicked out of the competition. Was that football? Come on. He should also apologize to Italy for the fully visible dive and pathetic red card. Did he or will he? Not for now it seems like.Oh and to all whom mentioned the Italian National Team is pathetic and so forth. Like it or not, Lippiâ€™s boyâ€™s came, saw and conquered. We lived with the shame of losing to South Korea, to France 3 times and to three shootouts. At this World Cup, the curse was broken as all the pain went away as the Azzurri rose from the ashes of past humiliations. A team which has never lost in regulation time for over 20 years at a World Cup and is seen as a favorite at every tournament deserves respect. And to all you Italy haters out there. Grow up and live with the shame that your side lost. We did for 24 years. Give Azzurri fans the respect they deserve and like it or not, they are World Champions till 2010. That is the name of the game.Or is it just a ploy from Blatter to stir support in Oceania and to appease other federations and we are all overreacting? Does it matter who gave Italy the trophy?

"According to embryonic reports reflected in Italyâ€™s â€˜Corriere dello Sportâ€™ newspaper, FC Barcelonaâ€™s young Albiceleste star will be the object of a Massimo Moratti approach. The idea is to bring Messi to San Siro as the biggest bombshell Nerazzurri signing since Ronaldo arrived â€“ also from Camp Nou. The â€˜Corriere dello Sportâ€™ reported Inter as readying a 90 million Euro bid to be sweetened by the inclusion of discontent marksman Adriano. Moratti is confident that the size of the offer will be enough to sway even the declared hardheartedness of BarÃ§a President Joan Laporta; determined to hold onto both Messi and Ronaldinho.With Eto'o still in dry dock with his knee ligament problem, the â€˜Corriere dello Sportâ€™ saw Adrianoâ€™s â€˜giftâ€™ inclusion as being a distinct catalyst for the deal to go through. â€œThe money that BarÃ§a would get for selling Messi will help the Catalan club pay for a Ronaldinho renewal for the next six years, as the Brazilian is looking for 12 million Euros per year and this deal would cover thatâ€￾, explained the Italian article.","Mon Nov 13, 2006 11:16 am",13,1393,World Football,Inter Preparing 90 Million Euros Plus Adriano For Messi

"Antonio Cassano has returned to the Real Madrid squad, but only because Ronaldo is out injured for a month.The Italian international had been frozen out of the side on October 30 after a furious row with Coach Fabio Capello.The tactician had said he would welcome him back if he apologised, but only two days ago Cassano told Sky Italia television that he would â€œnever say sorry until the day I die.â€￾Everything was set for a January sale, with Roma, Milan, Inter and Napoli said to be interested, but this evening the club announced this period on the sidelines was over.â€œFollowing a meeting with the player, the technical staff and his team-mates, all the issues have been clarified,â€￾ said a statement on the official website.The driving force behind this sudden reversal can be found in another former Serie A player.Ronaldo has been ruled out for a month with a new injury, straining the interior lateral ligament in his left knee.So the options have been cut down considerably in a disappointing period of form for Real Madrid, meaning Cassano is needed for Sundayâ€™s game against Osasuna.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","Sat Nov 11, 2006 4:09 pm",3,570,World Football,"Real forgive Cassano, but they had too."

"Unhappy Real Madrid striker Ronaldo is reportedly eyeing a January return to Italian giants Inter.The Brazilian was left disillusioned after Saturdayâ€™s match with Gimnastic when boss Fabio Capello told him to warm up in the second half, but didnâ€™t opt to throw the striker on.Real chief Ramon Calderon complimented the side for the 3-1 win, but Ronaldo distanced himself from the squad. â€œI donâ€™t need congratulating as I wasnâ€™t part of the game,â€￾ said Il Fenomeno.It has now emerged that the former Golden Ball winner has asked for crisis talks with Calderon, fuelling speculation that the player may return to Inter as early as January.Ronaldo controversially walked out on the San Siro outfit in 2002 after the club returned him to full fitness.However, his relationship with Nerazzurri owner Massimo Moratti has remained excellent, as confirmed by the summer rumours which had already paired Ronaldo with a sensational return. The Via Durini outfit on the other hand are in need of a striker after Alvaro Recobaâ€™s latest injury and Adrianoâ€™s dip in form. The latter could even be included in a swap deal with his countryman.In the meantime, Brazil Coach Carlos Dunga has left both Adriano and Ronaldo out of his latest squad for the friendly with Switzerland.â€œI want to help Adriano, but first of all he must help himself. Heâ€™s having a difficult time, therefore he should focus on the job,â€￾ said Dunga.â€œHe must change his behaviour away from the pitch, and the same can be said for Ronaldo,â€￾ concluded the SeleÃ§ao boss.","Wed Nov 01, 2006 6:20 pm",0,246,World Football,Ronaldo fancies Inter return

"Cassano â€˜perfectâ€™ for NapoliMonday 9 October, 2006Real Madridâ€™s transfer market consultant has this afternoon sensationally urged Antonio Cassano to join Napoli.Ernesto Bronzetti believes that the Serie B outfit would be the perfect environment for Cassano to live up to his potential should they win promotion to the top flight this term.â€œI think Napoli would be an excellent solution for him,â€￾ Bronzetti, the man who looks after all of the Spanish clubâ€™s overseas moves, told Radio Incontro on Monday.â€œCassano is a player who needs to feel that people believe in him and needs to be pushed on by the fans. â€œFor this reason, Napoli could offer him the perfect stage to express his high levels.â€￾Cassano joined Real in January after a Â£3.5m fee was agreed with Roma given that his contract had just six months left to run in Rome.However, the man nicknamed â€˜Talentinoâ€™ by the Spanish media, has struggled in Madrid â€“ even following the appointment of Fabio Capello as boss.As a result, Bronzetti feels that the ex-Bari starletâ€™s time with the European giants may be coming to an end.â€œWe all know that Cassano gets long faced when heâ€™s not playing and he tends to relax mentally,â€￾ he added.â€œUnfortunately there is a relatively clear situation in Madrid with Ruud Van Nistelrooy and Ronaldo the first choices, with Raul and Robinho the second reserves.â€￾Cassanoâ€™s lack of recent use by Capello, his former Roma mentor, has also cost him his place in the Italian squad.","Tue Oct 10, 2006 8:14 am",2,701,World Football,cassano to?

"Spanish radio stations have announced that Inter have agreed to send Adriano to Real Madrid in exchange for Ronaldo.Cadena Ser reported this evening that a deal has been struck between the Nerazzurri and Real, but that the only remaining issue to be worked out is Julio Baptistaâ€™s switch to Arsenal for Jose Antonio Reyes to free up a non-EC status place in Fabio Capelloâ€™s side.The transfer window closes on Thursday evening and a flurry of activity is expected in Serie A, possibly including the shock return of Il Fenomeno.Ronaldo, who left San Siro in a cloud of controversy in 2002, admitted this week that he had received offers from both Milan and Inter.â€œI honestly donâ€™t know what jersey I will wear next year, football players are always the last to know what is happening,â€￾ said Ronaldo in Monaco yesterday, where he was awarded the 2006 Golden Foot award.â€œI do not know what my destiny will be and in any case I could not confirm anything before details are finalised,â€￾ added the SeleÃ§ao star.â€œInter have made it clear that they are interested in me and itâ€™s always nice for me to think back to the time I spent there. I have been speaking to Massimo Moratti very often, but at the time being I cannot promise him that I will not go to Milan. In any case, I am very proud of the fact that two sides from the same city are both keen on signing me.â€￾Inter also commented over the past 24 hours that they have no intention of releasing Adriano, despite his angry reaction to a substitution in the 4-3 Italian Super Cup victory over Roma.â€œI think that Moratti has always said what he thinks of Adriano, in many different ways,â€￾ noted Roberto Mancini.â€œAnd the team, all his Coaches and the fans have always done the same. We all agree that we must have faith in Adriano.â€￾","Thu Aug 31, 2006 8:28 am",1,1376,World Football,Adriano-Ronaldo swap

"Ronaldo is set to leave Real Madrid and admits that he could join either Milan or Inter by the end of this week.â€œI honestly donâ€™t know what jersey I will wear next year, football players are always the last to know what is happening,â€￾ said Ronaldo in Monaco, where he was awarded the 2006 Golden Foot.â€œI do not know what my destiny will be and in any case I could not confirm anything before details are finalised,â€￾ added the SeleÃ§ao international, confirming reports from Spanish radio Cadena Ser.â€œInter have made it clear that they are interested in me and itâ€™s always nice for me to think back to the time I spent there.â€œI have been speaking to Massimo Moratti very often, but at the time being I cannot promise him that I will not go to Milan.â€œIn any case, I am very proud of the fact that two sides from the same city are both keen on signing me.â€￾Milan allegedly gave up their attempt to net Ronaldo last week, after no compromise could be reached with Real Madrid regarding a fee.President Ramon Calderon insisted that Milan midfielder Kaka be included in the deal, but the Rossoneri have long since stated that the player is not on sale.Inter instead could propose a swap deal involving Adriano, but Calderon has apparently asked for an additional Â£7m.There are only two days left before the summer transfer window closes and firm offers could be discussed as soon as Wednesday.","Tue Aug 29, 2006 10:10 pm",2,2953,World Football,RONALDO-MILAN DUO WANT ME

"The Brazilian striker stated that he always suspected there was something.Ronaldo went back on the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus demoted to Serie B due to Luciano Moggiâ€™s intervention in the refereeing system.â€œI did not expect these punishments, but we did suspect something of irregular for many years.â€œNow the Inter fans are happier. Very strange episodes occurred in the 1998 and 2002 seasons, which made me suffer.â€￾Ronaldo never managed to win the Scudetto during his time at Inter, but latest reports coming from Italy suggest that the striker is on his way back to the peninsula to wear the Nerazzurri colours once again.Fat sherry blame the Caciopoli on your disgraceful form wat a tip rat","Tue Aug 29, 2006 5:07 pm",4,2675,World Football,Ronaldoâ€™s Views On Calciopoli

"Adrianoâ€™s Inter future has been thrown into doubt once again after he reacted badly when substituted in Saturdayâ€™s Super Cup Final.Coach Roberto Mancini introduced Hernan Crespo 60 minutes into the game for Adriano, whose performance had been poor.The Brazilian striker left the pitch shaking his head, kicking some bottles of water and punching the bench on his way out.â€œI was mad at myself,â€￾ lâ€™Imperatore reasoned, although it now seems clear that the rift between the player and the Nerazzurri is as serious as ever.Mancini himself also tried to justify Adrianoâ€™s reaction: â€œSometimes a player gets mad at himself, itâ€™s a normal reaction when you are substituted in an important match.â€￾Adrianoâ€™s replacement was made all the more bitter when Crespo went on to score five minutes into his second debut for the outfit, contributing to Interâ€™s incredible victory over Roma.The future of the Brazilian international will now be decided in the next few days, as the summer transfer window is due to close on August 31.Inter owner Massimo Moratti is still keen on bringing former star Ronaldo back to San Siro, after Real Madridâ€™s negotiation with city rivals Milan failed.Reports in Spain suggested last week the Nerazzurri could propose a swap deal involving Adriano, but Real chief Ramon Calderon has apparently asked for an additional Â£7m.","Tue Aug 29, 2006 3:13 am",6,2773,World Football,Adriano unhappy at Inter
