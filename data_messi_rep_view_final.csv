Here they want to win immediately and there is no time to wait around for a youngster to prove himself, so clubs go straight to champions of experience who are considered reliable.

When you are obliged to win, second place in the table is considered failure and a Coach can feel the axe over his head from Week 1, you tend to rely on an experienced player rather than a talented youngster who needs more time to mature.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìOur youth systems are among the best in the world.

"Ronaldo: God Willing, I Will Move To SpainCristiano Ronaldo made it abundantly clear that his dream is to move to La Liga.The Portuguese had been linked repeatedly with a move to Spain following his World Cup fallout will Wayne Rooney, but seems to have settled down over the last six months or so.However, speaking in Zurich at the FIFA World Player award, he admitted that the desire to move to La Liga remains as strong as ever.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI would like to play for a Spanish club one day - I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if it is possible, but it is my dream,"" he declared.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìSometimes I want something and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not possible. But this is my dream.""Real Madrid and Barcelona have both been interested in him, and a fresh report earlier this month suggested that the Catalan club would make a big money move should Ronaldinho leave.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a fantastic league where they play beautiful football,"" he continued, reiterating his craving for Spain. ""However, I am convinced the English league is the most competitive in every aspect,"" he added quickly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI feel very comfortable in the English league.""I think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s beautiful, and if I stay in Manchester that would be great for me - I love the club; I love the supporters, and it would be amazing for me to stay there for many years.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut maybe one day, only God knows whether it will happen, I would like to play for a Spanish team and experience the difference.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæManchester United have made it abundantly clear that they have no intention of selling their biggest star, but the rumours continue to persist. These comments will only fan the fires.Many pundits believe that he will be able to showcase his real potential only in the realms of Spain's very latin football, so to speak, and the player himself seems to believe in it.There is a more shrewd view, of course. The fact that the comments came in light of losing out to Kaka and Lionel Messi mean that he himself understands how a high profile move to Barcelona or Real Madrid might be needed to deliver individual accolades.","Tue Dec 18, 2007 7:33 pm",32,2206,World Football,Ronaldo

When they see someone they like, they just take him. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey sign the boy to a professional contract, make all sorts of promises and then put him in their reserves and never give him a competitive game. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHow many young players taken by Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal have actually played for their first team and how many have returned?√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ Arsenal ace Cesc Fabregas is a sterling example of the √¢‚Ç¨Àúbuy them young√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ policy gone right, of course, while Gerard Pique is enjoying steady developments under Sir Alex Ferguson√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s expert tutelage, having been snapped up from Barca's academies.One would also be wise to keep in mind how many South American sides have levied the exact same accusations against Barcelona, Real Madrid and the like.

"Kewell v Crewe, Not ArgentinaWHILE the rest of the Socceroos are lining up to take on Argentina tomorrow, star Harry Kewell will be turning out to face Crewe Alexandra Reserves for the Liverpool Reserves again.The injury-plagued winger is one of the vital ingredients missing from the Australian side after not playing a single game for his Premiership club this season.Kewell appeared to be on the road back to full fitness following a whole year out last season in the wake of Australia√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s World Cup campaign, when he turned up on crutches for the vital Italy game.It was originally believed he had gout but that was later rediagnosed as being septic arthritis. He underwent treatment for that and a series of operations in Sydney for his recurring groin and joint injuries.He missed almost all of Liverpool√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s entire season last year but eased himself back to fitness with appearances in the reserves. Coach Rafa Benitez insisted he would not start him until he had reach √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOlympic√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ standards of fitness.He recovered just in time for Australia√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s disappointing Asian Cup campaign but failed to show his usual brilliance.But when he returned to his club after the Socceroo√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s dismal exit from the competition, he injured himself yet again in pre-season training with another groin strain.Just before his latest injury, Kewell admitted he thought his career may have been drawing to an end.""Thoughts like that did creep into my mind,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ he told his club√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s website.""There were fleeting thoughts. You get over one injury and then another one appears and all of a sudden you're wound up in one big mess and you think, am I ever going to be the same?""Since then Benitez has introduced Dutch wonderkid Ryan Babel into the squad as a potential Kewell replacement down the left flank.Harry was linked with a move to Spanish Segunda Division club Real Sociedad last month by newspapers in England but last week the Kewell camp scoffed at the suggestion.And today Sociedad manager Chris Coleman √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú former Fulham coach √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú admitted he couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t afford to take the Socceroo to Europe.In his column for the UK√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Daily Mail, he admitted: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìLast week we were linked with signing Harry Kewell from Liverpool, but have you seen my budget here? We have filled the left-sided position with the signing of David Vaughan from Crewe.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæNow Harry is battling once again for fitness and a place in a Liverpool first team which has been enjoying a successful start to the season thanks to new imports like Babel, Fernando Torres and Andriy Voronin, even with skipper Steven Gerrard under an injury cloud.His outing against Crewe Alexandra tomorrow night on a muddy playing field in the north of England is his latest step on yet another comeback trail.Instead of Carlos Tevez, Javier Saviola and Lionel Messi at the MCG in front of up to 80,000, he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be facing the stars of Crewe reserves like Stuart Tomlinson, Mark Carrington and Tom Pope in front of two men and their dog.""I've just got to roll with it. I've got to take my time and make my way into the game,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ Kewell said during the close season. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI haven't been out for this long and I'm looking forward to it.""I've been off for 12 months now and you almost claim that as a little retirement. It's rested my body, mentally and physically.""Obviously with the injuries I was still working but to just step back and watch games was good for me, to step back and relax a little bit.""But I'm ready now for the new challenge.""","Mon Sep 10, 2007 8:42 pm",7,782,World Football,"Kewell v Crewe, Not Argentina"
"Youth Development: The Euro StarsIn the second of our four-part series, we meet the Europeans who are leading the way in youth development. When a third of your country lies below sea level, you need a little blue sky thinking to keep your head above water. Fortunately that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an area in which the Dutch are masters. For more than a thousand years this tiny country has achieved the impossible and successfully reclaimed land from the ocean. In football, their accomplishments have been similarly miraculous. With a population numbering fewer than 15 million, a professional league only 50 years old and a comparative lack of financial resources, they have managed to consistently compete against the bigger nations of Planet Football. How? By becoming experts in youth development. No other country in the world has squeezed so much talent from such scarce resources as Holland. And if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Ajax who have a reputation as Europe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s premier producer of youth talent, the truth is that in every corner of this tiny nation, clubs are producing top-class footballers √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú and they have been doing for years. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAjax were always known for homegrown players,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says Andy Roxburgh, the former Scotland manager who is now UEFA√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s technical director. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey had wise old heads like Rinus Michels, Leo Beenhakker and Louis van Gaal who paid a lot of attention to the youth teams and talked a lot about grassroots. Rinus would talk about having a √¢‚Ç¨Àúred thread√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ from the top of the club to the bottom. Ajax√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s youth system was very well promoted, shall we say, but they certainly weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the only club doing it.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæThese days, says Edward Sturing, the head of PSV Eindhoven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s youth academy, five clubs dominate youth development: Ajax, PSV, Feyenoord, AZ Alkmaar and Heerenveen. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAcross all the age groups, the successful teams are spread between those five clubs, but no one club dominates,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ adds the former Holland international. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAjax have a great programme, but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no better than many other clubs.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæThe reason, says Roxburgh, is simple: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIn Holland, they don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t just make the kids do training drills. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re given time to practise on their own so they can develop individual skills. The preparation that goes into youth development in Holland is very detailed.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæBut what exactly does this detailed preparation involve? Asking the question to Sturing is like throwing a hungry dog a bone. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOK, let me show you on my laptop,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ he says, dragging FourFourTwo to his desk in his plush office inside PSV√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s youth academy. The next 20 minutes is like being back at school in a science lesson, as detailed coaching schedules, diagrams and charts for all the different age-groups flash before our eyes.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWith our seven to 12-year-olds the first thing we work on is individual skill, playing on their own,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ Sturing explains with gusto. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThen we move them into one-on-one situations. Then into two attackers against one defender. After that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s an eight-versus-eight game situation where winning is not important and the emphasis is on taking risks and playing attacking football. You can see with players like Arjen Robben [a PSV youth product] that this is the way he learnt to play the game.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæThis blueprint is not unique to PSV, either: it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s written and handed down by the KNVB, the Dutch FA, and all the country√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s professional clubs buy into the vision. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhen we play 11 versus 11 we must play 4-3-3,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says Sturing, pointing at yet another diagram on his computer. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a more difficult system, but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s more flexible and it means players can adapt more easily.√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ The small details are all taken care of. The KNVB states that for every under-17 team, there must be two head coaches (√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a difficult age, when boys become men,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ explains Sturing, pointing at his head), while at every club there is a dedicated skills coach and, remarkably, two √¢‚Ç¨≈ìco-ordination trainers√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe biggest problem for seven to 12-year-olds is ball control and body control,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ explains Sturing, dragging us outside to illustrate his point. On the training ground, we find four 12-year-old boys decked out in distinctive red and white PSV shirts with black shorts. The only time a ball is used is when they begin a one-handed throwing and catching exercise. The rest of the time they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re doing roly-polys, handstands and cartwheels. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou have to be the boss of your own body √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú and we can coach that.√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ Never mind total football, this is total training.But the top clubs do not work alone. Without the thriving local football scene they would struggle. There is no organised schools football, but there are nearly 2500 local clubs of which 95 percent have a fully functioning youth set-up. Every weekend all those clubs play competitive matches in the age groups between seven and 19. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a lot of football and a lot of footballers.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìIn Holland the pyramid is very big,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ explains Sturing, making a triangle with his two hands. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìTo have so many local clubs for such a small country is amazing, because the base of the pyramid is so big there is a lot of quality at the top.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæSo in terms of young players, the Dutch have quality and quantity, but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what they do with the raw materials that gives them an edge. Few can dispute that the best coaches in the world are produced in Holland. In 1999, FIFA honoured Rinus Michels as coach of the century. At last year√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s World Cup, there were four Dutch coaches √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú Marco van Basten (Holland), Guus Hiddink (Australia), Leo Beenhakker (Trinidad and Tobago) and grenache Advocaat (South Korea). In contrast there wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t a single Englishman.In Zeist, just east of Utrecht, the only dedicated coaches√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ academy in the world has been producing top coaches for the past 30 years. Today, there are more than 100 Dutch coaches working around the world and if CVs are anything to go by, the best of the current crop is Guus Hiddink. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBecause we are such a small country,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says Hiddink, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwe have to be very inventive. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why we get the best out of our young players and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why our training for coaches is long and hard and spread over many years.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæYouth coaches are particularly valued in Holland, with jobs in a club√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s youth set-up very prestigious. Half of the youth coaches at Ajax, Feyenoord and PSV are former players. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI think if you want to be a good coach you need to start right at the bottom,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says Sturing. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve coached at all the different age groups and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the only way you can make mistakes and try different things. If you start at the top level you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make mistakes because you then have a problem.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæAll of this begs the question: if Holland has the best coaches and the best youth system, why have they never won the World Cup? It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a whole different discussion of course, but if there is a criticism of the Dutch youth system, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s that there is too much emphasis on skill, technique and individualism. They may have produced some of the world√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s greatest attacking talents, but can you name a truly world-class Dutch defender? Henk Span, editor of Dutch football magazine Hard Gras, certainly struggles. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìRonald Koeman was more a √¢‚Ç¨Àúlibero√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ than a defender,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ he notes. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìAt the moment Khalid Boulahrouz is regarded as the best in Holland and he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not looked good enough at Chelsea.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæBut there are other reasons for Holland√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s failure on the world√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s biggest stage. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe Dutch are obsessed with playing beautiful football,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says Span. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d rather lose than win by playing ugly and that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never been world champions.√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ One country which has managed to become world champions and play great football is France. Over the last 10 years alone, they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve won the World Cup (1998), the European Championships (2000) and reached another World Cup Final last year. The reason is simple: they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve moved ahead of the rest of Europe in the development of players. On matchday one of this season√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Champions League, the country with the most players in the 32 starting line-ups was Brazil with 65. Next was France with 37. Portugal had 24, Italy 22, Holland 15, Spain 15, England just 14 while there were only 12 Germans.That France is now producing more top-quality players than any other country in Europe is largely down to George Boulogne. In 1966, he sat down with the French Football Federation and decided the national team weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t good enough. So, in 1973, he created the French academy system that was to lay the foundations for les Bleus becoming world champions 25 years later. Along with the club academies there are now nine regional elite centres (Clairefontaine is just one), where the best players spend the week before returning to their clubs at the weekend. Club academies and regional centres are residential and incorporate full-time football coaching alongside education. Former Monaco and Scotland midfielder John Collins believes that offering quality education at the academies is the key to ensuring unprecedented access to young footballers. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere is a lot of emphasis on education because the players live at the academies,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says the Hibs boss. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey come in at the age of 14 and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s train, school, train, school. They are under complete surveillance all the time so they have to work at their grades. At Monaco there were 14 classrooms within the club√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s stadium.√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ Over four years, between the age of 12 and 16, a French boy attending an academy receives 2304 hours of training, twice as much as in England. But it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not just more quantity, there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s quality too. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt was Gerard Houllier√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s idea to introduce what is known as √¢‚Ç¨Àúpreformation√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ training,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says Andy Roxburgh. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe idea was that between the ages of 13 and 16 most of the coaching should concentrate on individual work and developing technique. Gerard believed that if a player got to the age of 16 and his technique wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t up to scratch there was no way of ever catching up.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæOf course, academies aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t the only place to play football √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú Johan Cruyff and George Best didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t learnt in an academy, they learnt on the street √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú but cultural changes in Europe have seen street football decline for 20 years. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMarcello Lippi is always bemoaning that kids are playing far less street football today,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says Roxburgh. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIn central and northern Europe we really need to try and recreate an environment where there is more spontaneity and freedom of expression with a football. They play a lot of futsal in Spain and Portugal, which is what the Brazilians do, and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s great for the grass roots, but it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not so big in Europe. In the past, there were plenty of kids playing in the street so there were plenty of lads to choose from. Now, though, there have to be structures in place in order to find the best players.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæRoxburgh√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s favourite catchphrase is √¢‚Ç¨≈ìchance or design√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ. As head of grass roots development for UEFA, he has to be diplomatic about who are the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to youth development, but it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take a genius to gauge how alarmed he is about certain countries buying too many foreign players. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou can either take a chance, buy lots of players and hope they work out,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ he says, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìor you can do things by design and produce your own. English clubs have the money to buy players, and no restrictions on how many they can buy, so there will always be a glass ceiling for their own academy players.√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ Having too much money is a lame excuse, he adds, pointing to the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Lyon, Manchester United and Inter Milan as big clubs that are investing heavily in youth. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMost of the top clubs are doing it now because it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cheaper in the long run,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ he says. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBarcelona are a great example. [Lionel] Messi is Argentine, but he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s been with them since he was 12. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve produced [Cesc] Fabregas, Xavi, [Carlos] Puyol and [Andres] Iniesta.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæSo if Holland and France have got youth development licked, what about Spain, a country, like England, with a professional league that attracts the cream of the world√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s football talent?A glance at the national youth teams√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ record makes impressive reading. ""La Seleccion"" has won the European Under-17 championship six times, more than any other country, the UEFA Under-19 title four times and in 1999, with Iker Casillas in goal and Xavi anchoring the midfield, they claimed their first ever FIFA World Under-20 Championship.Spain also boast one of Europe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s best youth clubs √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú Antiguoko. Never heard of them? Fans of Liverpool and Everton should sit up and take note, because both Xabi Alonso and Mikel Arteta are graduates of the Basque club, whose under-16s made it to the national championship play-offs this year. Up against the youth sides of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Espanyol, they eventually lost to a Valencia side which included two players who had already featured for the first team. That Antiguoko, an amateur club with no official income and no stadium, even made it that far was nothing short of miraculous. So good are they at developing players that Liverpool are trying to sign them up as their feeder club, a move which is causing a major stink in San Sebastian because for years Antiguoko have had an agreement with Real Sociedad. The system in Spain usually has one main club being fed by several smaller local clubs. The parent club pays the feeder club a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsalary√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ and that ensures they get first pick of the best players.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe Spanish system is pretty comprehensive,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says Englishman Phil Ball, resident of San Sebastian and author of Morbo: The Story of Spanish Football. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey combine schools football and club football, so that one weekend the kids will play with the school and a week later they will play for the local clubs. The coaching is more specialised at the clubs and the best players at the local clubs then get invited to train with the professional club, but the school and club teams are being monitored all the time so nobody can slip through the net.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæOne player earning rave reviews in San Sebastian at the moment is an 11-year-old called Harry Ball, Phil√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s son (√¢‚Ç¨≈ìa chip off the old block√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ jokes Ball senior). He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s recently been invited to train with Real Sociedad. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not allowed to officially play for Real until he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 14, so until then he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll keep playing for his school and his local club and we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll see what happens.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæPhil Ball was a half-decent player himself and once had trials for Lincolnshire County Schools. His experiences in Spain and England couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be more different. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI found the county system in England very elitist,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says Ball. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOnce you got in the team you stayed there, and that was that, really. I find it amazing that people in England are getting upset that plans for an elite academy [the FA√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s national centre at Burton upon Trent] have been shelved. Why should they concentrate on a small number of top players? They should be spreading the resources throughout the regions and supporting the local clubs.√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ Ball also has some interesting views on the quality of youth football in Spain compared to England and believes that when it comes to the big boys, La Liga, and not the Premiership, rules the roost. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhenever I go back to England I watch kids of the same age as Harry and the main emphasis seems to be on running, breaking sweat and kicking the cabernet out of each other. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like the Premiership. Everybody says that because three English clubs made it to the semi-finals of the Champions League the Premiership is the best, but if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got a Russian oligarch shouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you be expected to make the semi-finals? For me, the best judge of whether a league has strength in depth is the UEFA Cup, where the middling teams play each other, and Spain has dominated that competition for the last two years.√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ The year 1995 was a great one for Ajax, but a grave one for Dutch football. On May 25 at the Ernst Happel Stadium in Vienna, Patrick Kluivert√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 85th-minute goal against AC Milan earned Ajax their first European Cup in 22 years. Louis van Gaal√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s side, who had won the UEFA Cup three years before, contained eight homegrown players. Seven months later, though, the world changed forever. When Belgian footballer Jean-Marc Bosman won his landmark ruling in 1995, the floodgates were flung wide open for out-of-contract players in the European Union to change clubs without a transfer fee. All of a sudden it was almost impossible for all but the richest clubs to hold on to their best players beyond the terms of their existing deals.Within two years of that Champions League triumph in Vienna, seven of the Ajax players had left to play in England, Spain or Italy. It had happened before, of course. After their hat-trick of European titles in the 1970s coach Rinus Michels and the two crucial Johans, Cruyff and Neeskens, were plying their trade in Barcelona. The difference with the Bosman ruling was that it gave an unprecedented freedom to all professional players.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhen I left Holland to play in England I was 27 and already a Dutch international,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says Arnold Muhren, the former Ajax, Ipswich and Manchester United midfielder who is now coach of Ajax√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s under-14 side. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThese days the players are leaving at 17, 18 and 19.√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ Muhren points to Liverpool√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s recent signing of 18-year-old Ajax striker Jordy Brouwer as a typical consequence of the Bosman ruling. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t succeed in England,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says Muhren with a hint of annoyance in his voice. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a good player, but he won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be playing in the first team. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so young and now he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s in country with a completely different culture, so he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be homesick. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gone for the money and nothing else. We need to give these players better and longer contracts so at least if they want to leave we can get a transfer fee for them. But it all comes down to money.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæAnother consequence of the Bosman ruling and the inexorable rise of the Champions League is the increasing gap between the rich and poor clubs. Ajax√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s annual turnover is less than √Ç¬£50 million ($118m), Manchester United√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s is √Ç¬£165 million ($388m). The new television deal for Premiership football will only widen that gap. In a typical display of Dutch resourcefulness the Amsterdam club have wrestled with the new challenges facing them and have attempted various changes in strategy. Ajax have joined the Stock Exchange, dabbled in ideas such as forming a North Atlantic League, extended their area of influence in the US and Africa and gambled on buying players on the cheap from Eastern Europe. But Muhren believes Ajax and the other Dutch clubs must stick to what they do best √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú nurturing talent.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere are now 100 players in the Dutch league who learnt their trade at Ajax,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says Muhren. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWhat we are doing is good for Dutch football and, for me, every penny spent on developing players outside of Holland is a waste. We have a satellite club, Ajax Cape Town, but the only decent player to come from there is Steven Pienaar. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no doubt that it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so much easier for us to mould and coach a Dutch player than a player from South Africa or Ghana. They have a different mentality and I think in Norway, Sweden and Denmark they would say the same thing.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæJohan Cruyff believes Holland is no longer producing the kind of skilful and exciting players that graced his generation. Unsurprisingly, his voice holds a lot of sway in the Low Countries, but on this subject he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s in a minority. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìCruyff is always going on about the 1970s,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ counters Henk Span. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut if you look at our youth teams from the age of 17 down, they are still winning international tournaments at all levels.√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ What has changed is that the age-old Dutch problem of having a shortage of good defenders is being addressed and that requires a new approach which purists like Cruyff despair of. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBefore now all players were selected for their skill and speed,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says Span. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSo Ajax signing a player like Vito Wormgoor marks a major sea change. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s big and tall and when he plays the first thing you notice is that he is not skilful. There are a thousand players like him in England √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like Tony Adams √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú but Ajax have never signed a player like this, so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a very interesting development.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæIn the post-Bosman era, many clubs in Europe gave up on youth development. Why develop your own players only to see them sign for another club when they turn 18? This prompted UEFA to insist clubs include a certain number of homegrown players in their squad. But because the EU does not allow discrimination by nationality, clubs can get around the rules. If anything, the directive has encouraged bigger clubs to poach players from other countries at an even younger age. No prizes for guessing which country is the worst culprit√¢‚Ç¨≈ìEverywhere I go I see scouts from England,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says Edward Sturing. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìSurely it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s better to develop your own players instead of taking ours? England is a big country, with a big passion for football, so surely there are a lot of talented boys there? It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just lazy, but because they have money they just buy the talent.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæNot that Sturing is downbeat. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re very lucky in Holland,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ he says. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMaybe if we had lots of money and a big population we wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work so hard on developing players. But that is why our national team is number six in the world.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæEngland, meanwhile, are two places lower and the two countries√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ records at major tournaments in the last 20 years is also worth considering. In the European Championships, Holland have one title and have reached three semi-finals; England have made it to one semi-final. Their World Cup records are level, with one semi-final apiece, but with populations of 60 million and 15 million, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not exactly comparing like for like.It seems that English clubs are unable or unwilling to put their efforts into developing homegrown talent, and instead adopt the role of football imperialists, determined to assert their influence around the globe. PSV Eindhoven are morphing into a feeder club for Chelsea, Arsenal have Belgian side Beveren, while Liverpool are tightening their grip on Antiguoko.Just as rising sea levels are giving Holland√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s landscape planners headaches, the globalisation of the game in the post-Bosman era is giving Dutch football even bigger obstacles. But they have a plan. Before 2011, Ajax want to increase turnover by six percent every year, return to the top 16 of clubs in Europe and win the Dutch championship once every two years. The club√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s main ambition, though, is to win the Champions League again. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIn the mid-1960s nobody in the world would have believed that Ajax could win the European Cup,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ says David Endt, former Ajax player and current team manager. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBut to everyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s amazement we won it three times. In the 1980s people were again saying Ajax could never win a European title again, but in 1987 we won the Cup Winners√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ Cup, in 1992 we won the UEFA Cup and in 1995 we won the Champions League. Now we are in a period where everybody is again saying we won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t succeed in Europe. But this club will always find a way to spring a surprise.√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ If they do return to the top of the European game it will not be achieved by purchasing success, but by making the most of the talent on their doorstep. As they say in Holland √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNo Youth, No Future.√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ","Thu Aug 16, 2007 8:17 pm",0,1034,Coaching Football,Youth Development

"Abhishek Thakur explains why Barcelona simply must sign Frank Lampard if he is available.A quick look at Goal.com√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s message boards is the appropriate thing to begin this with.  Says Abdul from Egypt: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìLampard has a rudimentary Premiership style that will not fit with Barcelona√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s flowing football.√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ He is not the only one, and I am willing to agree with him.  Kim from Korea offers a more comparative opinion: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìLampard will never have the technical ability that Deco has, and will never be able to perform that role.√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ I simply could not agree more.  And yet, I must disagree with the hypothesis that Rijkaard does not need Lampard. The key question is: must he perform that role? Let me use Andrea Pirlo and Milan as an example as I make my point, if only to keep our Serie A readers in the loop. Pirlo is one of the most complete midfielders around, and the one who can keep the Rossoneri functioning like a well-oiled machine. But imagine Milan playing with three Pirlos on the pitch! Perhaps they [the three clones] will have so much class that they will take up three different roles, and try to complement each other. They might even do it better than some speacialists would, but is that justification enough? Well, that is where Barcelona stand with Iniesta, Xavi and Deco. These are three players who have essentially very similar tendencies. Yes, no two players are similar, and they have shown that, working ever so hard to blend together in the same eleven. They are all quality players, and have even succeeded, for when they start running the show, they really do.  But again, is that justification enough? True, Lampard does not have the technique that these three have, the class that √¢‚Ç¨Àúpurists√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ including me like to gush over.  However, he has something that these three will never have, try as they may! He has something that Barcelona lack when they pass and pass outside the box, but struggle to penetrate those really organized defenses √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú midfielders bursting through, players offering something different.  How does that help? In two ways, one direct, one less so! First, when Lampard gets the ball outside the box, he goes for goal, and gets a majority of his shots on target. He can score with scorching drives, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìlucky√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ deflections or some tap ins after neat work from the forwards. There is surely method to the madness that gets him 20 goals a season.  Xavi has never been known to have a crack at goal. Iniesta, while having the imagination to surge into the box, lacks the accuracy, and more so the raw instinct. Deco is slightly better on those fronts, and does try the odd shot, but again, the Portuguese is a player who would prefer to play it back to Xavi, or out wide to Messi, than have a go. That is where the other part of my argument kicks in, the less direct one. When Lampard will get the ball outside the box, he will force defenders to come out and close him down quickly. That, in turn, would create more space for the forwards. Against Xavi and Deco, the opposing defense can afford to focus on keeping its shape, on remaining compact. There is no immediate urge to rush out and prevent that shot on goal.In other words, despite their imaginative attack, Barcelona can be made to look predicatable. With Lampard, there is that second option available, a very direct one, and an explosive one as well! Then, if he does choose to pass - and he can pass despite the ""English"" tag most Spanish and Italian fans are quick to stereotype him with - he will run his friends into more space.Finally, in what is most definitely not insignificant given Barcelona√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s front line, Lampard is far more effective in his own penalty area than Deco, Xavi or Iniesta. There may be fears that he will slow things down, but with the likes of Deco, Ronaldinho and Messi to pass to, I really do not see what the fuss is all about! He is a box to box midfielder, and those are seldom slow. Yes, there will not be those fancy flicks, but there will be a lot of no nonsense football.This article is not about how they will all fit in, for I admit that it will be a challenge to keep them all together. However, handling Deco, Xavi, Iniesta and Lampard will be no tougher than handling Henry, Ronaldinho, Eto'o and Messi.I personally believe Barcelona must be smart and play a 4-3-3, instead of tiring their four strikers out over the first four months by playing them all. Five midfielders (add Toure) for three spots is just about perfect, come to think of it. We haven't yet spoken of injuries, remember!There will be up to 60 games over 38 weeks for Barcelona, up to 68 for the internationals, so there is no reason why every player cannot get 40 games. It will also see them remain fresh for the business end of the season! If Rijkaard can stick to his 4-3-3 philosophy, and intelligently rotate his top players, he could well have the best team standing come April!Coming back to Lampard, I would like to conclude by saying that Barcelona do not need three similar players for a job that can be done by one, or at most two. Rijkaard's boys played some of their best football when Cocu, Davids and Xavi ran the midfield towards the end of his first year in charge. They were just as sensational when Marquez, Deco and Xavi did the business the season after. Iniesta, Deco and Xavi together on the pitch always seems to shout out: ""good, but too much of the same."" Lampard has something completely unique to offer, and Barcelona will be silly if they ""choose"" not to sign him!

"The David Suazo saga took another shock twist today! His contract clause releases him to Inter, so Milan pour their efforts into signing Ronaldinho.Cagliari had agreed to sell the Honduran hitman to the Rossoneri in a √Ç¬£10m deal, but the player had already put pen to paper with the Nerazzurri.Initially this was considered to be an illegal move, but after agent Giovanni Branchini met with Milan directors this afternoon, new details emerged.It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s claimed that a clause in Suazo√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s contract with Cagliari releasing him for √Ç¬£8m is valid for Italian sides as well as overseas.With this in mind, the Sardinians have little choice but to hand him over to Inter for a lower price than that offered by their rivals plus half of Under-21 international Robert Acquafresca.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìFrom what I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve seen recently we can say that there is a clear desire for the player to join the only club that courted him for a long time √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú i.e. Inter,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ said President Massimo Moratti.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe must make the most of that, besides our rapport with the others involved. We will see how it pans out.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæHowever, that is not the only development this evening. With Thierry Henry on the verge of completing his Barcelona transfer, this strongly suggests that the Spaniards will release either Samuel Eto√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢o or Ronaldinho.Milan have publicly stated on numerous occasions that they are their primary targets and so losing Suazo will be considered more motivation to go all-out for one of the international stars.If Lionel Messi is to be used as a supply line for Eto√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢o and Henry, then that means Ronaldinho is more likely to depart the Nou Camp.The Brazilian has long had a fractious relationship with teammates, his club and Coach Frank Rijkaard, while he has regularly hinted that Milan would be a good move.","Sat Jun 23, 2007 10:36 am",11,967,World Football,"Inter get Suazo, Milan look at R10"

"At first the points in common are evident in terms of the fact we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re talking about three players whose height was almost always cited as an obstacle to be overcome. Maradona stands 1.66m in his Albiceleste socks, Rom√É¬°rio √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú nicknamed √¢‚Ç¨ÀúO Baixinho√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ (Shorty) √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú is three centimetres taller than √¢‚Ç¨ÀúDios√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ (God) at 1.69m √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú exactly the same height as Lionel Messi.Fair enough, so none of them were going to be basketball players, but what of it? Those who claim that their height-wise shortcomings forced a certain idiosyncratic flair out of them wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be wrong either. To compete with their more corpulent peers all three forged their diminutive statures from weaknesses into weapons √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú although there are those who opine that the lower centre of gravity gave them a natural edge above lankier players.There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s also another common thread that could be seen as a causative factor in their growth √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú or lack of it. Both Maradona and Rom√É¬°rio hail from humble backgrounds in shanty towns / slums, the same breeding grounds that have seen some of the brassiest footballing talents in the world come from the muck of extreme poverty.Rom√É¬°rio was born near, yet so far, from the sun-kissed Rio de Janeiro shores he adores so much, the son of Edevair de Souza Faria and Manuela Ladislau Faria living in the Jacarezinho (Little Alligator) favela. Poverty-stricken, the future star√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s family had problems feeding the youngster and he grew at a slow rate.Diego Armando Maradona was born in run-down Villa Fiorito, a dirt poor district on the southern fringes of Buenos Aires to a poor family that had moved from Corrientes Province. The oldest of three brothers √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú who also went into football, albeit with far less success √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú also found his development stunted by a lack of food.At the age of 11, Messi was diagnosed with a hormone deficiency that stunted his growth √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú and would have stunted it even further had FC Barcelona not offered to pay for an expensive treatment that his poor family couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t afford. Apart from the physical aspects, all three have a point in common in a ball control that leaves the sphere apparently glued onto their boots. This has wound three generations of defenders and holding midfielders up to breaking points as it combines with their size very well.All three are capable of holding the ball up effectively with their back to a rival √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú or several √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú until support arrives, or to burn time in the last minutes of a game that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s got a favourable result. The low centre of gravity means they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re harder to nudge over than a taller player, sticking over the ball with limpet-like firmness near a sideline until they pass the ball or get fouled.The shorter legs are also a boon to manoeuvring in small spaces. Like a Mini Cooper compared to a Ford Mustang, the turning circle is so much smaller that gaps that appear impossible for the larger are easy to fit into for the smaller. Try watching √¢‚Ç¨ÀúThe Italian Job√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ (either version) and √¢‚Ç¨ÀúBullit√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ to get an idea if the metaphor fails to convince.All three attracted defenders like a flame attracts moths, sometimes drawing up to three or four exasperated rivals out of their team√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s tactical shape. This would, at its best, be followed by a sudden √¢‚Ç¨Àúhandbrake turn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ as the diminutive marvels shot out of the √¢‚Ç¨Àúscrum√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢.The Rom√É¬°rio comparison is lessened given the fact that out of the illustrious trio he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the sole right-footer, although there is a doppelganger similarity to some Messi moves in his killer instinct in the box and opportunism.Examples of moves that enchant spectators litter the careers of the retired √¢‚Ç¨ÀúDios√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢, the about-to-retire √¢‚Ç¨ÀúBaixinho√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ and the nowhere-near-retiring √¢‚Ç¨ÀúPulga√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ (Messi being nicknamed the √¢‚Ç¨ÀúFlea√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ for self-evident reasons) and linger in the memory with barely-restrained fondness, an aching longing and great memories that Messi is now resurrecting for Cul√É¬©s all over the world.They also all had seminal performances against the Merengues that are still recalled by those fortunate to have seen them first hand √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú and even those who saw them for the first time years afterwards. Although Maradona√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s time at Barcelona was short-lived, his performance at the Bernab√É¬©u √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú dribbling several defenders down the flank before scoring in 1983 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú brought a standing ovation only repeated years later for Ronaldinho. People still marvel at his 'rabona' move in which a shot, pass or cross is performed by moving the playing leg behind the weight-bearing leg and kicking the ball forwards with the first with the player's legs crossed. It's since been used by many players, notable Barcelona examples being Rivaldo - and Rom√É¬°rio.Rom√É¬°rio√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hat-trick against Real Madrid during the √¢‚Ç¨Àúmanita√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ (five-goal drubbing) inflicted by Cruyff√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Bar√É¬ßa on Benito Floro√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Merengues is also a moment that has become immortalised in Blaugrana memories, particularly the √¢‚Ç¨Àúcola de vaca√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ (cow√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s tail) move that saw him sweep the ball around Alkorta and score.Now it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Messi√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s turn to be forged into a consecrated idol after being the heart and soul of Barcelona against their white nemesis. His hat-trick may not have been the jewel in the crown of a win, but the fact that he equalised no less than three times is almost as good.His performance in the Bar√É¬ßa-Real Madrid Cl√É¬°sico ended with the final strike stroked past Casillas in the 90th minute, denying Capello√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Madrid three points that would have re-ignited their spluttering attempt to revive a Liga title challenge and sink Rijkaard√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s side at the same time.Argentinean sports daily √¢‚Ç¨ÀúOl√É¬©√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ made no bones about their view of how Messi performed and who it reminded Argentine observers of: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMessi is a clone of Maradona√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢What planet is he from?√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ, the last part echoing football pundit V√É¬≠ctor Hugo Morales who used the same phrase to describe Diego Armando Maradona during Mexico 1986 as a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbarrilete c√É¬≥smico√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ (cosmic kite) after his showing against England.With Maradona himself having broadcast his own opinion far and wide, there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s little doubt that the mythical number 10 sees Messi as his heir. Messi himself knows this and responds with wisdom. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìDiego is the greatest√¢‚Ç¨¬¶as always√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ, Messi underlined. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe only thing that I can do is to continue working, continue improving√¢‚Ç¨¬¶but not so that I can make the comparison clearer. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m here to carry on learning and evolving and we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll see what I can do.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøæIn Spanish there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a saying that comparisons are always hateable. Being compared to Messi and Rom√É¬°rio is clearly a compliment for any player, but perhaps we are in danger of looking to the past to find explanations for present glory√¢‚Ç¨¬¶.and to anticipate future paths when they still remain to be walked.It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a natural vice, but nevertheless a vice, which brings us to the last point of comparison √¢‚Ç¨‚Äúcontrast. Maradona√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s slide into cocaine addiction and his turbulent private life, Rom√É¬°rio√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s avoidance of training and sex obsession: plus the fact that they both spent a short time at Barcelona.Messi has so far steered clear of any mention of a troubled personality and his interviews reveal a relaxed, humble young man rather than a player with something to prove or a chip on their shoulder resulting in the growth of a super-ego. His only √¢‚Ç¨Àúscandal√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ has been to be present √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú not involved √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú at a Rosario bar argument that didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even end in a brawl. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hardly the sort of behaviour that stands comparison with either Rom√É¬°rio or Maradona; even at their most angelic.In time terms Maradona and Rom√É¬°rio √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú Ronaldo too √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú spent stunted stints at Camp Nou, although they perhaps burned themselves into memories precisely because they did so much to remember in such a short space of time. √¢‚Ç¨ÀúDios√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ may have found his time with the Catalans hampered by hepatitis and an ankle-shattering tackle by √¢‚Ç¨ÀúButcher of Bilbao√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ Andoni Goikoetxea, but shone so brightly we need to wear sunglasses over two decades later: 38 goals in 58 games is still a statistic that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s hard to match.√¢‚Ç¨ÀúO Baixinho√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢, perhaps one of the few to be able to compete with (or better) such scoring proficiency, like Ronaldo after him, came from PSV and exploded with 34 goals in 46 games, arriving and leaving almost exactly two decades after Maradona.Messi arrived, unlike the others, as a pearl to be cultured in Catalunya rather than a star who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d already proved their worth in gold √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú and arrived at Camp Nou on the backs of big transfers: a (then) record-breaking $10 million for the Argentine, √¢‚Ç¨Àúonly√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ $4 million for the Brazilian as PSV saw him as equally talented as truancy-prone. Leo has been nurtured at La Mas√É¬≠a (The Mansion), Barcelona√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s residential youth academy, rather than being a formed import that just needed slotting into the first team. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a different case to both Maradona and Rom√É¬°rio for a number of reasons, and similar in other aspects, but still a young man who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s continuing to develop and grow both on and off the pitch.We will continue to compare √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a human failing, this sentimentality, but who on earth would want to rob football of its sentiments? We love our teams with a passion that is almost as undying as it is inexplicable, an almost religious faith, and, just as passion is intimately related to love, we take joy from the comparisons of current stars to the ones of yesteryear.Messi may have aspects of Maradona and Rom√É¬°rio in aspects of his game, but he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s far from being a simple blend of either√¢‚Ç¨¬¶or even a hybrid with other idols thrown into the blender to produce √¢‚Ç¨Àúformula Messi√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢. Our comparisons of past with present players aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hateful √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú far from it √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú but they won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bring us closer to the truth which is that Lionel Messi has just started. Perhaps the best move is to just enjoy a player who will doubtless lead us to compare future players with a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou know, that player really reminds me of Lionel Messi√¢‚Ç¨¬¶√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ","Thu Mar 15, 2007 5:24 pm",0,334,World Football,Barcelona Alchemy

"finally a journalist who has the same opinion as i! :Wenger has last wordJONATHAN NORTHCROFTAshley Cole grabbed the headlines, but the Arsenal manager had the last laugh when the transfer window closedEven before the main business was concluded on transfer deadline day, it was clear that Arsenal had come out best. It was a coup more spectacular than if West Ham had signed Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano, then Lionel Messi to boot. The Gunners got rid of Pascal Cygan. Even more extraordinary, they persuaded someone √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù Villarreal √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù to give them money (√Ç¬£2m!) for him.Arsenal may not always win the Premiership, but they are usually top of the acumen league, and even by the standards of Ars√É¬®ne Wenger and David Dein, Thursday was a shrewd old day. William Gallas plus √Ç¬£5m for Ashley Cole, Julio Baptista plus √Ç¬£3m for Jose Reyes, the √Ç¬£3.4m signing of the Brazilian Denilson, Cygan gone.So much attention was focused on the controversies of Cole and Chelsea√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mutual courtship that few people examined the actual transaction. Chelsea needed a convincing left-back and got a player with claims to be Europe√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s best in that position. But full-backs don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t win cups and championships, centre-backs do. Strip away the hype for England players such as John Terry and Rio Ferdinand, and there is no better central defender than Gallas in the Premiership.Since the start of Sol Campbell√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s decline two seasons ago, Wenger has yearned for the right partner for Kolo Toure. Gallas √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù fast, versatile, intelligent, French √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù is his photofit Arsenal footballer. Even if he had received the √Ç¬£30m that Dein initially demanded for Cole, it is not certain that Wenger could have used the money to make a more suitable signing. The capture even has the secondary effect of weakening a rival. Jose Mourinho was desperate not to lose Gallas, but because he is 29 and had a year left on his contract, Chelsea valued him at just √Ç¬£9m. To Arsenal he is priceless.Baptista for Reyes, in a loan exchange with Real Madrid that is likely to become permanent, also looks nice business. Wenger has long coveted Baptista and made four bids for him in 2005 when he was still a Sevilla player, the last worth √Ç¬£14m. Versatility √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù that quality again √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù is the Brazilian√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s key attribute. He is young, scores goals, plays defensive or attacking midfield and even second striker, and his nickname (The Beast) indicates why he was originally identified as Patrick Vieira√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s successor. The √Ç¬£3m that Real also paid Arsenal represented the difference between their √Ç¬£14m purchase price of Baptista and the √Ç¬£17m that the Gunners spent on Reyes. But given that √Ç¬£6.9m of the latter was dependent on future success and appearances, and will not now have to be paid in full, the cash adjustment in Arsenal√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s favour is greater.Cole and Reyes have football ability that would make any manager loath to lose them. However, their future usefulness to Wenger was uncertain, given Reyes√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s problems in adjusting to the English game and Cole√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s irreparable fallout with Dein and the rest of Arsenal√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s board. He wanted to leave so badly that the consequences of denying him a move might have been self-defeating.Wenger completed his deadline day dealings by landing Denilson, a cultured 18-year-old midfielder and captain of Brazil√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s under-19 team, from Sao Paolo for a fee that could rise to √Ç¬£3.4m. He could prove another triumph for Arsenal√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s youth scouting. In the Under-17 World Cup in Peru last year, Denilson was outstanding, captaining Brazil to the final. Wenger already has his hands on the leading scorer from the side that beat Brazil there, Mexico√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Carlos Vela.Wenger√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s shrewd history in the transfer market hardly needs rehearsing. Reyes√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s departure leaves as his most expensive player Thierry Henry, who, costing √Ç¬£10.5m from Juventus seven seasons ago, may just about have been value for money. Over the past eight transfer windows Arsenal√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s spend has been √Ç¬£63.9m, while Chelsea have paid out √Ç¬£325.7m, Manchester United √Ç¬£117.7m and Liverpool √Ç¬£95.6m. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s easy to get swept away by the thrill of the purchase. Any shopper knows it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s only when you return home and open up the bags that you see what you have actually got. Some clubs may have felt pangs of regret the moment the deadline passed on Thursday night. At the Emirates stadium they couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe their luck.Arsenal finished the day with √Ç¬£6.6m in their pockets, the best defender in the Premiership in their squad, both √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthe Brazilian Steven Gerrard√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ and Brazil√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s youth captain arriving, and two underperforming players and a malcontent off their books. If they ever remake The Sting, Wenger and Dein should get the Robert Redford and Paul Newman parts.Gallas√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s future is likely to be at centre-back, but he may begin by filling the berth vacated by Cole. How Baptista fares will be intriguing. Six feet tall, direct and as hard of shot as he is in the tackle, he scored 38 goals in 63 games for Sevilla and has the potential to be the dynamic midfield all-rounder who fares best in the English game. At Real, where he played wide or up front, never in his favoured position, he still got eight goals last season.He was called The Beast because of his strength and physique even before he arrived in Spain, but there the sobriquet was embraced and Baptista became La Bestia. When assessed at the Copa America two years ago, he was so strapping, Brazil√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s doctors warned him his muscle tissue was growing too quickly. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve never been one of those guys that are in the gym all day to try to beef myself up. Although I must say there are not a lot of players about with such a strong and powerful physique as mine,√¢‚Ç¨Ôøæ Baptista said.Wenger hopes he proves well worth the weights.","Sun Sep 03, 2006 11:46 am",6,2486,World Football,one for gooners
