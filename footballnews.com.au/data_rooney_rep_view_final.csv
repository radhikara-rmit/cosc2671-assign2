"Memories of a January 6-0 thrashing are a likely source of motivation and terror when Newcastle players line up against Manchester United in Saturdayâ€™s Premiership clash. Kevin Keeganâ€™s men are at a low ebb. The â€˜saviourâ€™ has yet to work his miracles. Newcastle have not won a league game since December 15 and have taken just three points from a possible 27. Along the way, Newcastle have edge nervously from mid-table safety towards the fringes of the divisionâ€™s relegation dog fight. Off the field, there are suspicions that the club might be up for sale. Backroom changes and uncertainty caused by rumoured power intrigues have conspired to make this the best and worst time for Newcastle to meet Sir Alex Fergusonâ€™s team. Victory will be greeted with a eruption of glad tidings on Tyneside. Defeat and anything approaching the hiding administered in Manchester last month and the mood of despondency will deepen. With trademark optimism, â€˜KKâ€™ believes his team is well capable of delivering a shock to the visitorsâ€™ title ambitions, and he may well take some comfort from the history books. The last time a Newcastle side managed by Keegan faced United at St James' Park, the result was a famous 5-0 victory. Keegan also toasted 3-1 and 4-1 successes over United during his time as Manchester City boss.However, Keegan accepts that his team faces a hard struggle to contain the defending champions.â€œTheyâ€™ve got the form and we havenâ€™t, so weâ€™ll see if we can surprise a few people,â€￾ Keegan said. â€œWe know what is ahead of us on Saturday.â€œTwo weeks without a game has been a long time, and the last game against Aston Villa wasnâ€™t a good performance. Weâ€™ve had a little bit of a break and we have worked the players a little bit harder.â€œI have been pleased and we are building up to what is a very big game for us.â€￾Ferguson is likely to share that conviction. United return to Premiership action knowing that a recent dip in form has seen them lose ground to Arsenal in the title race.The teamâ€™s last league outing, a 2-1 reverse at home to local rivals City, was particularly disappointing. United will be looking for a winning performance at Newcastle to cap an excellent week at home and abroad.""We are in a position where we can't afford many slip-ups now,"" Ferguson said. ""I think there will be points dropped but we have to now motor on and get a good consistency about us and hope that our immediate opponents drop points.â€œItâ€™s not easy to close these gaps. Weâ€™ve achieved it in the past, and weâ€™ve failed to do it in the past. Hopefully experience counts. You know that points will be dropped. Arsenal and Chelsea are well aware of that. The name of the game is not to drop as many points as your opponents. ""At the moment, Arsenal have an advantage. But we also know that they have some tough games to come, so they will drop points. Itâ€™s unavoidable.â€￾Ferguson too can look to the history books too for pointers to the matchâ€™s outcome. United last lost two league games on the bounce some 107 Premiership matches ago, way back in April 2005, when they were beaten by Norwich and Everton respectively. That augurs well for a three point haul from the visit to Tyneside, but Sir Alex is taking nothing for granted.He added: â€œWe have got a decent record at St Jamesâ€™ Park, but that doesnâ€™t guarantee us anything. We know we have to perform on the day. Last season we were coasting at 2-1 and they got a late goal from a deflection. You can lose a goal in any game, at any time. We have to be alert to that.â€œNewcastle is one of my favourite venues. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed going there. You see the passion of their fans, and I enjoy that. I think itâ€™s one of the main games of the season in the sense of it being a football occasion.â€￾TEAM FORM Newcastle United  February 09 vs Aston Villa (A) LOST 4-1February 03 vs Middlesbrough (H) DREW 1 â€“1January 29 vs Arsenal (A) LOST  3 â€“0January 26 vs Arsenal (A) LOST  3 â€“0January 19 vs Bolton (H) DREW  0 â€“0 Manchester United February 20 vs Lyon (A) DRAW 1 â€“ 1 (Champions League)February 18 vs Arsenal (H) WON 4 â€“ 0 (FA Cup)February 11vs Manchester City (H) LOST 1- 2February 02 vs Spurs (A) DRAW 1- 1  January 30 vs Portsmouth (H) Won 2-0 TEAM NEWS Newcastle Newcastle are set to welcome back the coveted Frenchman Charles Nâ€™Zogbia after his one game suspension. Utility man Geremi is available again after his return from the African Cup of Nations.Nigerian Obafemi Martins is struggling for fitness after spraining his ankle on international duty in Ghana but inspirational Shay Given should be able to resume duty between the sticks after a hernia injury. Otherwise, Steve Harper will deputise and make his 100th appearance for the club.Squad: Given, Harper, Forster, Beye, N'Zogbia, Enrique, Cacapa, Taylor, Faye, Edgar, Butt, Smith, Milner, Duff, Barton, LuaLua, Owen, Viduka, Ameobi, Carroll. Manchester United Sir Alex Ferguson has a full squad from which to choose apart from long term casualties Ben Foster and Mikael Silvestre. Gary Neville is still no closer to the first team duty after nearly a yearâ€™s absence. Winger Ryan Giggs has recovered from a knock suffered in Lyon, leaving Sir Alex with the dilemma of whom to leave out, particularly in midfield. Champions League goal hero Carlos Tevez seems certain to start.Squad : Van der Sar, Brown, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Ronaldo, Anderson, Scholes, Hargreaves, Giggs, Rooney, Tevez, Kuszczak, Saha, Carrick, Nani, O'Shea, Fletcher, Park, Simpson.PLAYERS TO WATCH Michael Owen (Newcastle United): The England striker needs a lift-off in an injury-ravaged season. Six goals in 21 appearances is not a bad return in a poor side but the Newcastle captain will want to show the full range of his gifts before the cameras in a high profile game. United defenders should beware his turn of speed and his alertness in the box. Despite his struggle with injuries, Owen is not yet ready for the knackersâ€™ yard.Wayne Rooney (Manchester United): Another England front man who is having a somewhat mixed season. Rooney seems to have mislaid his goals compass since returning from an autumn injury. He has scored crucial goals for United but has missed chances that a player of his stature should bury. This patchy form cannot last. Sooner or later Rooneyâ€™s eye will be in, to devastating effect. Might Saturday evening be perfect timing? PREDICTION No joy for KK against the champions. His team is in a rut, lacks pace and there are too many players treading water. How will one of the leakiest defences in the division hold at bay Manchester Unitedâ€™s multi-pronged attack? Nothing has changed fundamentally since the teams met last month. With Sir Alexâ€™s team desperate to repair the damage caused in recent weeks to its defence of the title, keeping the scoreline respectable seems to be Newcastleâ€™s only hope.

""However, I am convinced the English league is the most competitive in every aspect,"" he added quickly. â€œI feel very comfortable in the English league.""I think itâ€™s beautiful, and if I stay in Manchester that would be great for me - I love the club; I love the supporters, and it would be amazing for me to stay there for many years.â€œBut maybe one day, only God knows whether it will happen, I would like to play for a Spanish team and experience the difference.â€￾Manchester United have made it abundantly clear that they have no intention of selling their biggest star, but the rumours continue to persist.

"December 13, 2007â€˜Deal me inâ€™ says Fabio Capello as FA gets its No 1 manThe board of the Football Association will today be asked to approve Fabio Capello as the next England head coach. The Italian has agreed in principle to succeed Steve McClaren and has left his legal team in London to complete negotiations. After a three-hour meeting at Wembley Stadium yesterday, Brian Barwick, the FA chief executive, was sufficiently encouraged to believe that he had got his man and if he is given the green light by Capelloâ€™s lawyers this morning, will put his name before the 12-man board in a series of telephone conversations this afternoon. Barwick was buoyant after Capello made a flying visit to London and was shown around Wembley before sitting down for a meeting with Sir Trevor Brooking, the FAâ€™s director of football development, Barwick and Adrian Bevington, the director of communications, most of which was conducted in English. Capello departed for Italy later citing a prior commitment, but could return tomorrow for a formal presentation at a Soho Square press conference. Capello left the final round of contractual talks to his legal representatives, including Pier Filippo, his son. The contract is believed to take him through to the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa, with the option of another two years to include the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine. His salary will be in the region of Â£4 million a year net. Any appointment will need the ratification of the FA board, which is made up of five professional members, five representatives from the county associations, plus the chief executive and Geoff Thompson, the chairman, who do not have a vote, but Barwick has made it clear that he views support for his recommendation as fundamental. If he was to be embarrassed by his employers at this late stage, he would be left with no option but to resign, leaving the national game in meltdown. Capello also made no secret of his position, arriving yesterday on a scheduled flight from Milan and leaving the same way from Heathrow. The only concession he made to anonymity was the blackened windows of the vehicle that drove him to Wembley for his first face-to-face talks with his future employers. Further evidence of Barwickâ€™s single-minded determination to get Capello was provided by Marcello Lippi, the former Italy coach, who was also on the shortlist. It would appear that since the FA sounded out JosÃ© Mourinho, Capello is the only manager who has been formally approached. â€œNobody has called me so far,â€￾ Lippi said. â€œAnyway, I think Capello is the best possible choice for England. You only have to see how many trophies he has won in his career to realise what his qualities are.â€￾ Capelloâ€™s backroom team has yet to be confirmed, but sources in Italy were anxious to play down talk of a confrontational approach with the biggest names in the England squad. Capello, 61, is said to have had positive words for Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney and insists that there is no hangover from his days with David Beckham at Real Madrid. Beckham was left out of Capelloâ€™s team for the first half of last season and returned only after proving his commitment to the cause with hard work in training. But Capello claims they parted on good terms after Beckhamâ€™s resurgence helped Real to the title. Provided that he is fit, it is likely that Beckham will win his 100th cap in Capelloâ€™s first game, against Switzerland in February.","Thu Dec 13, 2007 3:04 pm",15,885,World Football,Deal me inâ€™ says Fabio Capello as FA gets its No 1 man

But Noel, 40, famous for hits including Wonderwall and Some Might Say, is a die-hard fan of Unitedâ€™s arch-rivals City. He immediately hatched a plan to have the guitar sprayed light blue. Noel also scrawled his own message on it to Wayne: â€œHappy Birthday Fatboy.â€￾ Scouser Coleen had it sent to Noelâ€™s record label in London to be signed in time for England striker Wayneâ€™s 22nd birthday tomorrow. The guitarist and singer was dumbstruck by the request, but was only too happy to have a bit of fun. source said: â€œNoel couldnâ€™t believe it. Mancs and Scousers havenâ€™t been the closest of friends â€“ and asking a City fanatic to sign a guitar for a United player is a red rag to a bull. It was a gift for Noel â€“ he loves a wind-up.â€￾ It is not the first time Noel has left an outrageous message for a United player. He was asked to sign a guitar for defender GARY NEVILLE in 2000 and scrawled â€œHappy birthday k***headâ€￾ on it. Coleen has also bought Wayne a Louis Vuitton manbag and a designer woolly jumper.

"Manchester City boss Sven Goran Eriksson says centre-back Micah Richards is invaluable to the club, as the manager waits on the player to sign a new contract.'Richards Is Priceless' Says Svenzoom - galleriaRichards has set the league on fire this season with a series of commanding displays that shadow the fact that he is only 19-years-old.With England also, the youngster has shown his ability at right back and is a good bet to take over from the injured Gary Neville on a permanent basis.The defender currently has three years left on a Â£14,000 a week contract at Eastlands, however the city board are busy trying to thrash out a new deal for their starlet.With Manchester United and Chelsea sniffing around the situation Eriksson has revealed that he believes that Richards is priceless.â€œI haven't asked for a couple of weeks about Micah's contract situation. I hope there is progress but we have both been away and I will find out this week what is happening,â€￾ he told The People.â€œI'm not surprised he's been linked with Chelsea and Manchester United but I really hope we can keep him here because if we can get him to sign a new contract that would be our best signing ever.â€œIt's important to everyone here because it would send a strong message to everyone. I couldn't even think about his value in the transfer market right now.â€œI suppose he is priceless to us, but it would certainly be a transfer that would go through the roof and I don't say that because Iâ€™m manager of Manchester city-I think everyone would see that.â€œMicah is a fantastic professional. I've had Rooney as a teenager and Baggio in Italy when he was 18, but they were different types of player. I've never had a player with physical presence of Micah Richards, he's unbelievably quick and strong.â€￾In the absence of Richard Dunne, Richards will be handed the captain's armband against Aston Villa this afternoon, an indication of the esteem in which the defender is held by his manager.â€œIt's a good idea to give Micah the captaincy in Dunne's absence,â€￾ Eriksson continued. â€œI don't know him extremely well yet, but he has no problems with either junior or senior players. He is always smiling when he comes in, he has no problems in the world. He just wants to play and if I asked him to play centre forward he would.â€￾","Sun Sep 16, 2007 10:33 pm",16,951,World Football,'Richards Is Priceless' Says Sven

"Despite the fact the Jose Mourinho's jibe at Liverpool was uncalled for and below the belt, the fact that Liverpool have not come even close to winning the Premirship under Rafa Benitez, remains. Itâ€™s hard to criticise Liverpool at the moment as they prepare to take part in their second Champions League final in three years. Prior to the so called â€œRafalutionâ€￾ hitting Anfield, football fans worldwide would have laughed at the idea of Liverpool regaining their reputation in Europe - lost over 20 years ago. They have since muted those voices, but business remains very much unfinished. So, why havenâ€™t Liverpool been able to make any strides in breaking their seventeen year Premiership drought?Rafael Benitez came to Liverpool three years ago with a glowing reputation, leading Valencia to two La Liga titles and a Uefa Cup. With this in mind, who could pass judgment on the renewed optimism for the red half of Merseyside? However, the original optimism of the Liverpool faithful has turned into a barrage of unanswered questions, as keen football lovers have been left scratching their heads wondering what Rafa needs to do in order to come close to winning the Premiership. Liverpoolâ€™s away record over the last three years has left a lot to be desired. Losing as many games away from home this season as the likes of Fulham, Reading and Manchester City and more than Everton, Tottenham and Aston Villa there is no wondering why Liverpool have been out of the title race since September. Avoiding Defeat On The RoadDoes Rafa try to avoid defeat first instead of trying to win away from home (the very tactic that yields results in Europe)? With an average of less than a goal a match away from home, there is enough evidence to condemn Rafa for deciding to field one striker for the majority of Liverpool's away matches. It may be more than a coincidence that Liverpool have only won 21 of their last 57 matches away from home in the league. But for some great displays in front of the Kop, that would not even have been sufficient for a Champions League berth!No Creative Lynch PinUnder Rafaâ€™s reign, Liverpool have also struggled to convincingly record positive results against the lower teams of the Premier League. Could it be that Liverpool are missing a creative player with the ability to break down the ultra-defensive strategies employed by bottom teams in the league? The â€œnine men behind the ballâ€￾ tactic employed by many teams, often leads to frustration for the Liverpool supporters. It has become obvious that the principal factor behind Liverpoolâ€™s inconsistency against ultra-defensive tactics is a key creative player, who can break down any defensive wall. He had an in form Pablo Aimar at his disposal at Valencia.The likes of Chelsea and Manchester United have found games against smaller teams no more than a slight obstacle, with the likes of Arjen Robben, Joe Cole, Christiano Ronaldo and Ryan Giggs in their ranks. Just like Scholes and Lampard are brilliant but still need those players, so does Gerrard. He offers a major driving force going forward; however to an extent isnâ€™t that creativive genius teams need. Alonso also likes to dictate the game from way too deep and Luis Garcia (currently injured) seems to only be a temporary fix as he continues to lose possession way too often.Rafa himself is aware of the problem, and has tried to bring in the likes of Daniel Alves and Simao, two world class creative wingers (Alves is pretty much a winger) who would potentially help bring an extra dimension to Liverpoolâ€™s game. However on both occasions was priced out of a potential deal. Zenden, Mark Gonzalez and Pennant don't cut it.Lack Of FundsCan Rafa therefore blame the lack of transfer funds made available by the Liverpool board? Much has been made of the takeover of Chelsea and Manchester United in recent years. Abramovich has spent over $700million in four years on big name players, whilst Glazerâ€™s takeover has allowed Manchester United to indulge in a mammoth move for Michael Carrick. Before that, the likes of Rooney, Ferdinand, Saha, Evra, Alan Smith and Ronaldo had been purchased for close to $200 million, even if averaged intelligently over five years.Rafael Benitez hasnâ€™t, however, had this luxury in the transfer market as he tries to strengthen his squad with the limited amount of money made available to him. Purchases such as Gonzalez, Bellamy and Aurelio have left the Reds in danger of falling further behind the top two. The recent takeover of George Gillett and Tom Hicks should put an end to Rafa continuing his trend of purchasing what many describe as mid-range targets.With the quality that Liverpool have at the moment and the likelihood of a number of world class signings in the summer, the possibilities for Liverpool are endless. The platform has been laid for Rafa to finally show his class and take the Premier League by storm. And he must, or he will quickly run out of excuses!","Tue May 15, 2007 9:36 am",30,2642,World Football,Rafa Must Solve Premiership Problems

"Jordan: Milan can do it Sunday 22 April, 2007 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Former Milan man Joe Jordan thinks Manchester United can be defeated at Old Trafford and outlines how it can be done.The Scotsman ought to know, as his Portsmouth beat Sir Alex Fergusonâ€™s squad 2-0 a fortnight ago.â€œWe attacked them and used all our strength. We were fortunate with Rio Ferdinandâ€™s own goal and Edwin Van der Sarâ€™s error, but there wasnâ€™t a single moment in that match when we released our grip,â€￾ he told â€˜Il Giornaleâ€™ newspaper.â€œThat constant aggression is the only option against the strongest side in the Premiership. If I were Carlo Ancelotti, I would play with the 4-4-2 system at San Siro, but the 4-4-1-1 at Old Trafford.â€œEven when Manchester United are under pressure, they always manage to score. In the first 20 minutes theyâ€™ll come for Milan like a wolf going for the jugular.â€￾Roma were thrashed 7-1 here in the quarter-finals, but Jordan does not think Milan will fall into the same trap.â€œThe Rossoneri are a lot more experienced in this type of game. Roma took the wrong tactical approach, as they were not prudent enough. Milan will not make that mistake and have players who are guarantees at this level.â€￾The two teams crossed paths in 2004-05, as Ancelottiâ€™s men won both legs 1-0 to progress.â€œMilan have a good history here, but Manchester have matured with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo since then. They are the freshest and most potent of the four semi-finalists. Milan are more relaxed, but when I watch Kaka I always expect something wonderful to happen.â€￾Jordan is still fondly remembered by the Rossoneri fans, having made the move from Manchester United in 1981.â€œI had been earning Â£25,000 per season, but got double those wages in Milan. I accepted that challenge after having rejected offers from Bayern Munich and Ajax when I was still at Leeds United,â€￾ added â€˜Lo Squalo.â€™â€œMilan were a grand club, more prestigious than Manchester, as it was the side of Cesare Maldini, Fabio Cudicini, Gianni Rivera and Nils Liedholm.â€￾ pr22j.html","Mon Apr 23, 2007 5:54 pm",59,5953,World Football,AC Milan Thread

"CSI: Lucas NeillBy Jesse FinkFriday, April 20, 2007 at 01:59pmMany moons ago, well three months ago actually, I blogged on Lucas Neillâ€™s baffling decision to turn down Liverpool and join West Ham in a Â£1.5million, three-season deal from Blackburn Rovers. At the time I shared the prevailing view of fans that it was a disappointing, even retrograde, step for a player who, through the strength of his football and unbreakable character, had become the most popular footballer in Australia since Harry Kewell. The bloke could do no wrong. It was no wonder Nike got him to star alongside Ronaldinho and Wayne Rooney in those slightly odd-looking Skins posters. Neillâ€™s public image, his â€œQ-scoreâ€￾, ran off the scales.imagePic montage: Chris Pavlich/Gregg PorteousThe reasons for Neillâ€™s decision to join West Ham are well known. What remains a mystery is what on earth he was thinking when he made it. Certainly after his tremulous performance in a less-than-convincing interview with Foxâ€™s Total Football, it was hard to believe he even believed what he had done himself.Itâ€™s hardly got any better for him since that show went to air.Now, with a four games to go in the English Premier League season, West Ham look certain goners, scuppering (temporarily at least) Eggert Magnussonâ€™s plans to turn the London club into a Premiership and Champions League contender.Of more interest to Australian fans, though, is that precious get-out clause in Neillâ€™s contract that will make him a free agent when the Hammers go back to the Championship.If we are to swallow the Neill line, he wants a club where heâ€™s guaranteed first-team football and where he can exercise his â€œambitionâ€￾. A cynic might reply: What better way to do that than stick with the Hammers and claw their way back into the Premier League?The truth is, though, that Neill is already looking to jump ship (the experience of basking in the glow of Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and his mates, and living Magnussonâ€™s â€œdreamâ€￾, clearly wasnâ€™t all it was cracked up to be.) In a recent interview with Londonâ€™s Telegraph he confirmed he would leave and even suggested that famous get-out clause wasnâ€™t even his idea.â€œIt was actually the club that spoke about it first, rather than me suggesting itâ€¦ Iâ€™ve gone along with that but I donâ€™t want to bring that clause into play.â€￾Right, thatâ€™s cleared up then. If West Ham drop, Neillâ€™s going. But to where? What â€œbigâ€￾ clubs worthy of his talent will have him? Liverpool wonâ€™t have a bar of him, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United scarcely need new right backs, and after that, well, the chances for exercising that oft-stated â€œambitionâ€￾ in the Premiership virtually disappear. On the continent, the chance to join Barcelona sadly seems to have completely evaporated, if it ever existed at all.Rovers fans have fiercely turned against him and how will Hammers fans react when he ships out along with Carlos Tevez? He wonâ€™t be getting roses and farewell cards, thatâ€™s for sure.Neill will no doubt find an employer somewhere â€“ heâ€™s too good a footballer to not be working, and a move to chronically underperforming Newcastle United has been mooted â€“ but whoever signs him will need to correct his attitude: any player who turns down Liverpool because he isnâ€™t guaranteed first-team football suggests a personality that isnâ€™t willing to test himself against the best. And not even the best â€“ this includes his own team-mates.What top-level coach wants a player who considers himself an automatic selection, no matter the team? Not even the best players in the Premiership â€“ Frank Lampard, Ryan Giggs, Shaun Wright-Phillips, etc â€“ are unbenchable. Playing a â€œbit partâ€￾ is the lot of virtually every footballer at Europeâ€™s G14 clubs.Wherever Neill ends up, it can only be hoped that heâ€™s learned a valuable lesson and that his mistake will be heeded by other Australian players in future who get dazzled by the sight of piles of pounds stuffed into cotton sacks. No matter how much you are paid, no matter the promises made to you, nothing is more valuable than your reputation.Itâ€™s something thatâ€™s very hard to obtain but all too easy to throw away.Fortunately for Neill, his is salvageable. In the green and gold jersey at least, he remains a highly popular figure and is unquestionably captain material.The last thing he will want to be known as is the David Caruso of football. Caruso, you will remember, got too big for his boots on NYPD Blue and quit to concentrate on his film career. Then he made Jade.Heâ€™s now back in television, on CSI: Miami, having learned the hard way that misplaced ambition can sometimes get your life in an awful mess and what you already have to begin with usually ainâ€™t that bad at all.True leaders show their strength in adversity, and Neill will have had plenty of exposure to that lately. May he come back in season 2007/08 even stronger.","Sat Apr 21, 2007 12:06 pm",2,431,World Football,CSI - Lucas Neill - from Foxsports

"Is having three clubs in the last four of the UEFA Champions League a triumph for England, or the countryâ€™s ability to attract some of the worldâ€™s best talent?With Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool still on course for Europeâ€™s most glittering prize, is this pursuit losing its lustre when these teams are made up almost entirely of foreigners?And, what role have the foreigners played in making the English Premiership, as Sir Alex Ferguson claims, â€˜the best league in the worldâ€™?Letâ€™s go back to a time when Italy, not Britannia, ruled the waves. During the late 1980s, when strict quotas kept the influx of foreign players to an absolute minimum, the Italians were masterful, helped by bucket loads of cash, much like England today, in identifying the best money could buy.Juventus won just about everything with Frenchman Michel Platini and Polish star Zbigniew Boniek. Napoli went the South American route, buying Diego Maradona, Careca and Alemao. Inter Milan developed a German edge with Lothar Matthaus, Jurgen Klinsmann and Andreas Brehme. And, AC Milan dominated Europe with the Dutch trio of Marco Van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard.In those days, a maximum three foreign players, per team were permitted in Serie A, which also meant club managers had to be shrewd and very selective with what they bought as only the very best would do, and rightly so.In Napoliâ€™s case, as Maradona mesmerised the globe with his nimble trickery, the southern club had to retain the right balance of local talent to build a team around the Argentine. The trophies that followed, two Italian league titles and a UEFA Cup, were a reflection of the overall quality of Italian football, not just Maradonaâ€™s genius.During the most recent Real Madrid golden era, which produced three European crowns between 1998 and 2002, nobody disputes the foreign contribution made by the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo, Predrag Mijatovic, Fernando Redondo or Roberto Carlos, but a considerable slice of credit also goes to the teamâ€™s large Spanish component.Nowadays, in the liberated world of the European Unionâ€™s free trade market, teams on that continent are mostly shedding their national identity in pursuit of silverware. Maybe the clubâ€™s country of origin is to blame for not producing enough star quality to stay loyal to their own. Ultimately, those with money can afford to combine the best of both worlds.The search for a foreigner more often than not leads to a big name signing, match winners like Cristiano Ronaldo, Didier Drogba, Andriy Shevchenko and Michael Ballack.They also occupy key areas of the pitch, robbing the likes of an Alan Smith, Joe Cole or Shaun Wright-Phillips the opportunity they need to develop their game on the big stage.If, for argumentâ€™s sake, Smith, Cole and Wright-Phillips are not in favour, they end up at mid-range clubs like Everton, Middlesbrough and Tottenham. The education they receive there in competitions like the UEFA Cup is simply not the same.The potential knock-on effect this has on a national team can become a major concern, as it did in Italy when its doors swung wide open to incorporate more and more foreigners throughout the 1990s, a period they dominated. Cultured Italian players combined with the best of the rest made for a lethal cocktail of tactical and technical superiority.However, as the four-time world champion Azzurri struggled in international tournaments, many critics argued that top clubs were not promoting the countryâ€™s most promising youngsters. This is a separate issue, but one that is being addressed in the interests of restoring international football. The clubs, guided by their national associations, have a critical role to play in ensuring that happens.At the moment, the UEFA Champions League has developed in to a World Cup of sorts. Twenty six different nationalities are represented in the final four. UEFA calculated the breakdown of countries represented by including those who have played some part in tournament.For example, Australia is recognised for only having one representative, that being AC Milanâ€™s Zeljko Kalac for his three appearances, while Harry Kewell is technically part of the Liverpool squad but injury has made him unavailable thus far so he does not count according to UEFA.By the way, England possesses an alarmingly small number of players - 21 - considering three teams qualified from that country, compared with 15 players from Italy which has only one team through to the semi-final stage.England is the third country to produce three semi-finalists in the UEFA Champions League. Spain was the first, with Valencia, Barcelona and Real Madrid in 1999/2000, followed by Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Inter, in 2002/2003.Looking closely at the composition of each squad, though, only Manchester United deserves recognition for the way it represents England. Chelsea and Liverpool are the products of a system overflowing with too much cash and not enough sense. They have ignored their responsibility to England partly because a Portuguese and Spaniard run the show.Sir Alex Ferguson may be Scottish but after 20 years at Old Trafford he knows the English landscape better than anyone else. The longevity of his success in being able to regenerate the Red Devils over and over again is enough to even make Mourinho envious.United possesses a solid core of past and present English internationals including Wayne Rooney, Gary Neville, Michael Carrick, Rio Ferdinand, Alan Smith, Wes Brown and Paul Scholes. Chelsea provides John Terry, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and Shaun Wright-Phillips. Liverpool weighs in with Steven Gerrard, Peter Crouch, Stephen Warnock and Jamie Carragher.All of those mentioned might be considered solid professionals, but put them together in the same side and, as their performances for England prove, few of them make a huge difference.Using Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool as my talent pool, I have taken a team of English internationals and pitted them against a selection of foreign All Stars.England (4-3-3): No goalkeeper available; Carragher, Ferdinand, Terry, A. Cole; Gerrard, Carrick, Lampard, J. Cole, Crouch, Rooney. Manager: Nobody qualifiesForeign All Stars (4-3-3): Cech; Finnan, Carvalho, Vidic, Heinze; Xabi Alonso, Makelele, Giggs; Cristiano Ronaldo, Drogba, Shevchenko. Manager: Sir Alex FergusonI believe the foreigners would win, and maybe so will England in the long run if they can learn from them, but to say English football is now the best in Europe based on what has occurred in this seasonâ€™s UEFA Champions League would be a mistake.Ferguson claims to have the answer to this ongoing debate. He says, â€œThe Premiership is the best league in the world. These things go in cycles. English clubs dominated in the 1980s, the Italians were fantastic in the 1990s and the Spanish in the early 2000s.â€￾â€œThey had three teams in the semi-final one year, so they were the best in Europe at that point. But, gradually, the English clubs have gone above that. The form of Barcelona and Real Madrid this season has not been up to their usual standard anyway, and the English clubs have moved ahead.â€￾The problem for me is that outside the top four teams in England, I find it hard to appreciate the overall standard of the Premier League. In Spain, however, at least half the teams are more than competitive and mostly enjoyable to watch.You only need to look at Osasuna and Espanyol, two of the three Spanish teams, along with Sevilla, through to the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup. They are sitting mid-table or lower at present in La Liga.The UEFA Cup exposes the continentâ€™s second tier clubs, providing a fairly accurate indication of which country currently boasts the best football right across the board. Spain has won that race in 2007.English clubs may be thriving at the top end of town in the UEFA Champions League, but I look at what lies beneath the surface. And, if you remove that sexy foreign accent, ask yourself this, â€˜what would be left to admire?â€™.If the same foreign quota that regulated European club football 20 years ago was still in effect, I think English club football, like the countryâ€™s national team, would have been left in the wilderness.","Wed Apr 18, 2007 11:16 am",1,356,World Football,England's sexy accent - Andrew Orsatti
