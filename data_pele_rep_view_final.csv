"Arguably the greatest footballer of all time, Diego Maradona, has apologised for the â€œHand of Godâ€￾ goal he scored against England in 1986. He also had some words for David Beckham and Ashley Cole, and branded Pele as â€œthe enemy of all time.â€￾zoom - galleria â€˜Hand of Godâ€™ & England ApologyMaradonaâ€™s most (in)famous game during his glittering and eventful career came in the quarter-finals of the 1986 World Cup for Argentina against England.The then Napoli star notoriously put his side in the lead by flicking the ball past Peter Shilton with his hand. He then added a simply stunning second by taking on half of the England team in what has been described as the best goal of all time.Since the game Maradona has always refused to apologise for the handball, labelling it as the hand of God. More than two decades later the 47-year-old has finally said sorry.â€œAn English supporter came up to me this weekend, asked me for an autograph, and said, â€˜You are a legendâ€™. â€œThis made me very happy. Your people are so polite and kind despite the history between our countries,â€￾ Maradona told â€˜The Sunâ€™.â€œIf I could apologise and go back and change history I would do. But the goal is still a goal, Argentina became world champions and I was the best player in the world. â€œI cannot change history. All I can do now is move on.â€￾ Drugs & PeleMaradona also spoke about his notorious struggles with Cocaine in the past, an addiction that nearly cost him his life in 2004 when he had a massive heart-attack and fell into a coma.â€œI lost a lot of my footballing talent to drugs,"" he admits. ""If I had never touched cocaine I would have been three times as good a player.â€￾Maradona has had a long and bitter feud with Brazilian hero Pele. Diego has long accused Pele of being part of the â€˜devilâ€™ family of FIFA. The feud hit new heights in 2000 when FIFA conducted an internet fan poll to elect the â€˜Player of the Centuryâ€™.Maradona won the poll but then FIFA changed the way in which the winner was chosen, and decided to give the prize to Pele. Maradona protested and eventually both players were presented with an award, with the Argentine claiming that his rivalâ€™s trophy was worthless. â€œThere would be no debate about who was the best footballer the world had ever seen â€” me or Pele. Everyone would say me,"" he insisted. â€œPele is the 'enemy of all time'.â€￾ Beckham & ColeMaradona also offered some forthright views on David Beckham and Ashley Cole.â€œBeckham is a nice man and Iâ€™m sure he will reach 100 appearances for England. But he is just a good player, nothing more,â€￾ said Diego.â€œHe has a good long-range shot, but heâ€™s not a great player â€” he doesnâ€™t belong to the superior group of players. â€œThere are hundreds of Beckhams playing football all over the world. ""As for Cole, he needs to demonstrate he can forget girls and concentrate on football.""Robinson, McClaren & Englandâ€™s Euro 2008 FailureMaradona was critical of former England manager Steve McClaren, saying he made a big mistake in the 3-2 defeat to Croatia that cost the Three Lions qualification to Euro 2008.â€œUnder Steve McClaren there was a problem. He wasnâ€™t a capable manager of the national team,â€￾ the ex-Napoli star continued. â€œIt was a big mistake to drop Paul Robinson for the Croatia game. Robinson would never have made the mistakes that Scott Carson did. â€œRobinson is a very good goalkeeper who has had a few problems â€” but strikers would have thought twice about shooting at him from long range because doubt would have entered their minds. â€œWith Carson they thought, â€˜Who is this playerâ€™? and took shots from everywhere.â€￾ Legend Maradona won the World Cup with Argentina in 1986, while he also was instrumental in leading Napoli to the Serie A title in 1987 and 1990.","Fri Feb 01, 2008 7:54 am",27,1428,World Football,Maradona

"Adriano cut from Juve clash 	Saturday 3 November, 2007Adriano has not even made the trip to Turin for tomorrowâ€™s big game with Juventus. â€œWe decided together,â€￾ said Roberto Mancini.The Brazilian was left in the stands for the midweek 4-1 win over Genoa and stormed out of the stadium when he was told the news, refusing to watch the match at San Siro.Now he has been cut from the squad completely for Sunday nightâ€™s Scudetto showdown against Juve.Coach Mancini has been notoriously irritable when asked about Adriano in Press conferences, so he took the matter into his own hands straight off the bat.â€œI shall ask the first question myself. Why no Adriano? Because we decided together. That is all.â€￾Mancio refused to answer any further questions or comment on the reasons behind this mutual decision, but it represents another major break in the rapport between player and club.A January sale now looks practically inevitable, as Adriano is not on the Champions League squad list and rarely used in Serie A either.The other four strikers at Interâ€™s disposal have made the journey up to Turin with Julio Cruz, Hernan Crespo and David Suazo battling to earn their spot alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovic.There are issues in midfield, though, as Dejan Stankovic and Patrick Vieira are sidelined.Inter squad: Julio Cesar, Orlandoni, Alfonso; Cordoba, Zanetti, Maxwell, Maicon, Burdisso, Rivas, Samuel, Chivu; Figo, Dacourt, Cambiasso, Solari, Pele', Cesar; Ibrahimovic, Cruz, Crespo, Suazo.i guess that solves that mystery.","Sun Nov 04, 2007 12:16 pm",26,1400,World Football,Derby of DEATH!

"Barcelona and former Arsenal star, Thierry Henry is refusing to rule out a future move to Americaâ€™s MLSAfter signing for Spanish giants Barcelona for Â£16.1 million from Arsenal only this summer, many would expect striker Thierry Henryâ€™s mind and lifestyle to be settled in Spain.Instead he today told The New York Times â€œI think everybody knows I love America.â€￾ He added â€œI always say that one day I can play over there. I would love to. But itâ€™s still early. I just love the U.S. I donâ€™t know why.â€￾â€œI love the way you live. I love American sports. For me, itâ€™s a dream to go to training and then see a game of football, basketball, whatever game. For me, New York is the best city in the world.""The Frenchman is comfortable in America and he already has connections across the Atlantic - he was the best man to San Antonio Spurs star Tony Parker at his recent wedding to Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria.He is clearly a fan of the American lifestyle and has taken Basketball to his heart â€œWhen I go to see a game, it is never boring. I love the speed, everything, especially more now that I have friends in the N.B.A.â€￾The global brand of Thierry Henry is not be underestimated as he currently features in adverts with Roger Federer and Tiger Woods, and he has this week been named as the global face, of clothing giant, Tommy Hilfiger, making the U.S. public aware of his sporting presence.America has produced many African-American global sports stars over the years, notably perhaps Michael Jordan, but they havenâ€™t produced a football (or soccer) star of African-American origin yet. Brazilian legend Pele playing for the NY Cosmos in the 1970s was one of its kind, but the sport was not nearly as serious in the country back then, not because of the lack of stars, but perhaps for want of shrewd marketing. With things looking a lot better now, Henry could well be the catalyst.The Frenchman recognises the importance of providing a role model to the youth and he has set up Stand Up Speak Up campaign to raise awareness of racism in football, but knows it is a global dilemma â€œWe still have the same problem everywhere - Spain, Italy other countries.â€￾Major League Soccer, as football is referred to in America, has gained international notoriety since the arrival of David Beckham at Los Angeles Galaxy. Such is the interest that in Britain a weekly magazine show, David Beckhamâ€™s Soccer USA, shown on Channel Five, has been devoted to his involvement.American soccer has enjoyed considerable success in the past, notably in the 1970s when international stars were persuaded to see out the remainder of their careers in America. Despite hosting the World Cup in 1994, Americaâ€™s domestic league has failed to ignite the passions of the majority of its countrymen and the rest of the worldwide football community. Using the 1970s model of attracting known international stars, such as Beckham, and Denilson to promote the stature of the league on a worldwide scale, has so far payed dividends. The league could be accused, though, of becoming a bit of a working retirement home for players who are perhaps coming towards the end of their careers, with the majority of its international star players over the age of 30.","Wed Oct 17, 2007 8:33 am",8,1215,World Football,Henry Considers America Switch

"Kaka ignores Real millions Sunday 17 June, 2007 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kaka has rejected Real Madridâ€™s offer to double his wages and earned the title of â€˜Best in the worldâ€™ from Pele.Ramon Calderon has repeatedly announced his intention of bringing the Brazilian to Spain, but Milan have been just as adamant that he is going nowhere.This week both clubs confirmed that Real representatives met with Kakaâ€™s father â€“ who acts as his agent â€“ but that it was only to officially turn down the proposal of Â£8m per season.That is double what he currently earns at the San Siro, although the Rossoneri will improve his contract this summer to pay Â£4.3m until 2012.It is also reported that the new deal to keep him in Italy will include the signing of younger brother Digao â€“ currently playing in Serie B with Rimini â€“ and a firm attempt to bring good friend Andriy Shevchenko back to Milan.Failing that, then Ronaldinho is the next player down on the list of transfer candidates.Kaka was the top scorer with 10 goals in this seasonâ€™s Champions League and lifting the trophy in Athens makes him the runaway favourite to win the Ballon dâ€™Or.Now he has also received the seal of approval from his hero, Brazilian legend Pele.â€œCristiano Ronaldo is without doubt the best player in England, as everyone recognised this year, but thatâ€™s a long way off being the best in the world,â€￾ said â€˜O Reyâ€™ at a charity event in Angola.â€œKaka, on the other hand, is a player with qualities that make him better than Cristiano Ronaldo and that will allow him to be among the greatest of all time.â€￾","Mon Jun 18, 2007 11:04 am",0,163,World Football,Kaka ignores Real millions
