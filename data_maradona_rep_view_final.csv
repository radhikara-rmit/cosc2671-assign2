"its no secret our club has been cabernet the last 10 yearsthis is the start of our way back to the top Johan Cruyff answers distress call from the club where legend was createdJohan Cruyff is to return to Amsterdam after 20 years to become the new technical director of Ajax in the wake of the Dutch clubâ€™s board announcing that it would resign at the end of the season. As a player and as the embodiment of total football, Cruyff transformed Ajaxâ€™s fortunes in the Sixties and Seventies and the Dutchman was the star of the show when the Amsterdam side won the European Cup in 1971, 1972 and 1973.Schoolboys growing up in the Seventies were mesmerised by his astounding goals, his phenomenal dribbling and â€œthe Cruyff turnâ€￾, but since resigning as the coach of Barcelona in 1996, he has preferred to stay on the side-lines, writing about Ajaxâ€™s slow decline in a column for De Telegraaf, the Dutch newspaper.Cruyff has had a lot to write about. Ajax are a shadow of the side who became one of the most stylish and effective teams that the world has seen. The Dutch club used to be the best side in the world, now they are not even the best team in the Nether-lands. The four-times European champions have not won the Dutch league title since 2004 and last lifted the European Cup in 1995. This season, Ajax, who trail PSV Eindhoven by nine points at the top of the Ere-divisie, crashed out of the Champions League in the qualifying round to Slavia Prague and were knocked out of the Uefa Cup by Dynamo Zagreb.â€œNobody has ever â€“ and I mean ever â€“ said, â€˜You fix it,â€™ â€￾ Cruyff said on Monday. â€œThey donâ€™t dare ask. Because if I have to do it, I will fix it, but Iâ€™ll do it in a way many people wonâ€™t like. Thatâ€™s why they keep me at armâ€™s length.â€￾ The decision to turn to Cruyff was taken after the publication of an internal review into the running of the club criticised directors and recommended drastic action. After a crisis meeting on Tuesday evening, the board, including John Jaakke, the chairman, agreed to step down in May and will be followed out of the door at the Amsterdam ArenA by Adrie Koster, who became the temporary head coach after Henk ten Cate left to join Chel-sea last October. Koster is likely to be replaced by Marco van Basten, who has announced that he will quit his job as the coach of Holland after the European Championship finals in Austria and Switzerland this summer.Times have been so tough at Ajax that last summer the club signed Albert Luque and Dennis Rommedahl, two of the most ineffective wingers to have played in the Premier League. It is all a far cry from the glory days when Cruyff was staking his claim to be the best player in the world. David Miller, the former Chief Sports Writer of The Times, called the mercurial forward â€œPythagoras in bootsâ€￾. Players as talented as Cruyff â€“ PelÃ©, Diego Maradona and George Best â€“ rarely become great managers, but the Dutchman followed up winning two trophies as a Barcelona player by guiding the Catalan club to their first European Cup triumph, in 1992.Cruyff still lives in Barcelona, although he returned to Amsterdam to manage Ajax from 1986 to 1988 without much success. Not that it dented his popularity at a club where he lifted 19 trophies and in a country where he has been voted the sixth-greatest Dutchman. In 1999, he was also voted European Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics, and only PelÃ© stopped him claiming the world title in the same poll.As a player, Cruyff chose to sign for Barcelona in 1973 instead of Real Madrid because he did not want to play for a club associated with General Franco. In 1978, he took another stand by refusing to play for Holland in the World Cup finals while Argentina was governed by a military junta. Recently, he has concentrated on running the Johan Cruyff Welfare Foundation, a charity that cares for children with physical handicaps and learning difficulties.They donâ€™t make them like they used to.","Thu Feb 21, 2008 10:43 pm",11,490,World Football,Cruyff returns to Ajax

"Arguably the greatest footballer of all time, Diego Maradona, has apologised for the â€œHand of Godâ€￾ goal he scored against England in 1986. He also had some words for David Beckham and Ashley Cole, and branded Pele as â€œthe enemy of all time.â€￾zoom - galleria â€˜Hand of Godâ€™ & England ApologyMaradonaâ€™s most (in)famous game during his glittering and eventful career came in the quarter-finals of the 1986 World Cup for Argentina against England.The then Napoli star notoriously put his side in the lead by flicking the ball past Peter Shilton with his hand. He then added a simply stunning second by taking on half of the England team in what has been described as the best goal of all time.Since the game Maradona has always refused to apologise for the handball, labelling it as the hand of God. More than two decades later the 47-year-old has finally said sorry.â€œAn English supporter came up to me this weekend, asked me for an autograph, and said, â€˜You are a legendâ€™. â€œThis made me very happy. Your people are so polite and kind despite the history between our countries,â€￾ Maradona told â€˜The Sunâ€™.â€œIf I could apologise and go back and change history I would do. But the goal is still a goal, Argentina became world champions and I was the best player in the world. â€œI cannot change history. All I can do now is move on.â€￾ Drugs & PeleMaradona also spoke about his notorious struggles with Cocaine in the past, an addiction that nearly cost him his life in 2004 when he had a massive heart-attack and fell into a coma.â€œI lost a lot of my footballing talent to drugs,"" he admits. ""If I had never touched cocaine I would have been three times as good a player.â€￾Maradona has had a long and bitter feud with Brazilian hero Pele. Diego has long accused Pele of being part of the â€˜devilâ€™ family of FIFA. The feud hit new heights in 2000 when FIFA conducted an internet fan poll to elect the â€˜Player of the Centuryâ€™.Maradona won the poll but then FIFA changed the way in which the winner was chosen, and decided to give the prize to Pele. Maradona protested and eventually both players were presented with an award, with the Argentine claiming that his rivalâ€™s trophy was worthless. â€œThere would be no debate about who was the best footballer the world had ever seen â€” me or Pele. Everyone would say me,"" he insisted. â€œPele is the 'enemy of all time'.â€￾ Beckham & ColeMaradona also offered some forthright views on David Beckham and Ashley Cole.â€œBeckham is a nice man and Iâ€™m sure he will reach 100 appearances for England. But he is just a good player, nothing more,â€￾ said Diego.â€œHe has a good long-range shot, but heâ€™s not a great player â€” he doesnâ€™t belong to the superior group of players. â€œThere are hundreds of Beckhams playing football all over the world. ""As for Cole, he needs to demonstrate he can forget girls and concentrate on football.""Robinson, McClaren & Englandâ€™s Euro 2008 FailureMaradona was critical of former England manager Steve McClaren, saying he made a big mistake in the 3-2 defeat to Croatia that cost the Three Lions qualification to Euro 2008.â€œUnder Steve McClaren there was a problem. He wasnâ€™t a capable manager of the national team,â€￾ the ex-Napoli star continued. â€œIt was a big mistake to drop Paul Robinson for the Croatia game. Robinson would never have made the mistakes that Scott Carson did. â€œRobinson is a very good goalkeeper who has had a few problems â€” but strikers would have thought twice about shooting at him from long range because doubt would have entered their minds. â€œWith Carson they thought, â€˜Who is this playerâ€™? and took shots from everywhere.â€￾ Legend Maradona won the World Cup with Argentina in 1986, while he also was instrumental in leading Napoli to the Serie A title in 1987 and 1990.","Fri Feb 01, 2008 7:54 am",27,1428,World Football,Maradona
