2016,10,Fallon d'Floor 2016 nominee : Cristiano Ronaldo,2016-10-26 10:51:22,8358,798,"First of all, the ref has to have the balls to call that at this level.  Once a player goes down like that - especially if he has the nerve to turn to face the ref mid-air like Ronaldo always seems to do - a decision has to be made and the appropriate action for that decision.  Either the ref thinks there was a foul and a free kick is given - or the ref thinks the player is trying to con the ref and everyone on the planet and a yellow card must be given.  If none of those things happen, the ref has bottled it and should be re-trained (the third option is that it was just normal football contact and play on - but that is not really an option in this case from the footage).  I don't even mind that much if he gives a free kick if he thought there was a foul, at least he is making a decision based on what he saw - but when he makes a decision on what he saw (eg - no foul at all, just a player trying to con the world) and then not follow the rules (yellow card for simulation/unsportsmanlike conduct) - then that is bottling it and needs to be addressed.

Secondly, this is the kind of garbage that causes Ronaldo to be hated.  I find it genuinely hard to see how anyone can think he not a huge twat.  Sure, he does some charitable things that are easy to do when you have the money and fame he has, but at the end of the day he is also a conniving, cheating bastard trying to screw over everyone he can to get to the top.

Thirdly, the manager should have the balls to do something about this, or he is just as bad as the person trying to cheat.  By not doing anything about it, he now has no right to whine about any poor decisions against his team or anything on morality in football.  The club board are in the same boat, along with the rest of the team.  

Fourthly, the league and/or FIFA can stop this kind of crap in about 2 weeks if they start penalising diving like this.  Just give old mate a ban for 3 weeks for this and everyone else who does something this obvious and you watch the game change almost overnight.  All of the sudden managers and club boards will not tolerate their players doing this as they will be down a player due to suspension and paying money for players who spend weeks and weeks on the sidelines.  Any player who continues to do it will not only find themselves short of football, but short of contracts as no one is willing to pay for a player who dives.  Either the players stop diving or they sit out games and hurts the club.  The media pressure on this type of stuff and the players who do it will be way more intense compared to what it is now as it is not just a guy having a crack at a cheap free kick with no real downside if it doesn't work - instead it is a player screwing over his club and supporters by trying to cheat and getting suspended for it.

I did not saw any pain in his face when he looked at the ref. This can kill your performance in less then a couple of seconds if you can`t connect with the audience and make them believe that you are in pain and that something went wrong here.

I know that it sound like I am judging him too harsh but Ronaldo has to work on his puppy face look a lot more to make us believe.

To make it look like a real foul he has to step up his acting a lot more then he did so far otherwise he won`t have a chance at the upcoming awards.

2017,3,This statue of Cristiano Ronaldo.,2017-03-29 14:06:09,11678,259,"As a sculptor I can tell you a little bit about what is going on here. The first issue is that a amateur sculptors approach clay like a canvas and basically paint the face on it. Similar to painting or drawing they create each individual piece in the location where it should be but they do it more from memory. They know an eye goes here and here and so that's where they put eyes without looking at his eyes or thinking about where they go in relationship to anything else. That is why each bit of the face looks OK but creepy when put together. 

Second issue in conjuction with that is that the face is nearly flat. I guarantee if you look at that from the side it'll look like a bunch of face parts glued to a board. 

Lastly (at least that I'll cover) is that by making the face first the creator then tried to add the head and end up adding more and more to try to get the sides even. Ending up with this monstrosity. 

Tl:Dr if you want to sculpt start with large shapes then add details. Step back to examine your work and the subject often. Anatomy and proportion are important. ",2017-03-30 00:14:01,1

His Bayern offside goals are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical Bielsa physics most of his genius deflection shot against Buffon in Cardiff will go over typical /r/soccer Messi fanboys head

 There’s also Benzema massive-assist outlook, which is deftly woven into his stats- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Kevin De Bruyne, for instance. The Madridistas understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these theoretical concepts, to realise that they’re not just bullshit- they say something about SOCCER. As a consequence people who don't think CR7 should win Balon D'Or truly ARE messi fanboys- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in CR7 catchphrase “SSSIUHHHHHHH,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Maradona - Live is life. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Marcelo genius elbow unfolds itself on Messi's nose. What culés.. how I pity them. 

And yes, by the way, i DO have a CR7 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for Ay-Mi-Madre-El-Bicho’ and ViscaEspanya only- and even then they have to demonstrate that their karma is higher than mine (preferably, twice as much) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ",2017-12-07 19:08:33,7

I actually don't think I've ever seen a team as dominant as that Real under Zidane. While Pep's barça was great and the most enjoyable to watch, this Real team is as strong in the back as it is lethal in the forefront. I mean, look at Ramos' game, it's not even fair",2018-04-03 20:31:32,1

2018,7,Cristiano Ronaldo letter of goodbye,2018-07-10 15:34:21,7779,988,"These years in Real Madrid, and in this city of Madrid, have been possibly the happiest of my life. 
 
I only have feelings of enormous gratitude for this club, for this hobby and for this city. I can only thank all of them for the love and affection I have received. 
 
However, I believe that the time has come to open a new stage in my life and that is why I have asked the club to accept transferring me. I feel that way and I ask everyone, and especially our followers, to please understand me. 
 
They have been absolutely wonderful for 9 years. They have been 9 unique years. It has been an exciting time for me, full of consideration but also hard because Real Madrid is of a very high demand, but I know very well that I will never forget that I have enjoyed football here in a unique way. 
 
I have had fabulous teammates in the field and in the dressing room, I have felt the warmth of an incredible crowd and together we have won 3 Champions in a row and 4 Champions in 5 years. And with them also, on an individual level, I have the satisfaction of having won 4 Gold Balls and 3 Gold Boots. All during my time in this immense and extraordinary club.
 
Real Madrid has conquered my heart, and that of my family, and that is why more than ever I want to say thank you: thanks to the club, the President, the directors, my colleagues, all the technicians, doctors, physios and incredible workers that make everything work and that are pending every detail tirelessly. 
 
Thank you infinitely once more to our fans and thanks also to Spanish Football. During these 9 exciting years I have had great players in front of me. My respect and my recognition for all of them. 
 
I have reflected a lot and I know that the time has come for a new cycle. I'm leaving but this shirt, this shield and the Santiago Bernabéu will continue to always feel as my own wherever I am.
 
Thanks to all and, of course, as I said that first time in our stadium 9 years ago: Hala Madrid!",2018-07-10 15:34:39,17

2018,7,Cristiano Ronaldo letter of goodbye,2018-07-10 15:34:21,7779,988,"These years at Real Madrid, and in this city of Madrid, have been possibly the happiest of my life. 

I just have feelings of enormous gratitude for this club, for this hobby and for this city. 

I can only thank them all for the love and affection I have received.

However, I think the time has come to open a new stage in my life and that's why I've asked the club to agree to transfer me.

I feel that way and I ask everyone, and especially our followers, to please understand me. 

It's been an absolutely wonderful nine years. It's been a unique nine years. 

It has been an exciting time for me, full of consideration but also hard because Real Madrid is very demanding, but I know very well that I will never forget that I have enjoyed football in a unique way here. 

I have had fabulous teammates on the pitch and in the dressing room, I have felt the warmth of an incredible fan base and together we have won 3 Champions in a row and 4 Champions in 5 years. 

And together with them, on an individual level, I have the satisfaction of having won 4 Golden Balls and 3 Golden Boots. 

All during my time at this immense and extraordinary club. 

Real Madrid has conquered my heart, and that of my family, and for that reason more than ever I want to say thank you: thanks to the club, to the President, to the managers, to my colleagues, to all the technicians, doctors, physios and incredible workers who make everything work and who are untiringly attentive to every detail. 

Infinite thanks once again to our fans and thanks also to Spanish Football. During these 9 exciting years I have had great players in front of me. 

My respect and appreciation for all of them. 

I have thought a lot and I know that the time has come for a new cycle. 

I'm leaving but this T-shirt, this shield and the Santiago Bernabéu will always feel like something of mine wherever I am. 

Thanks to everyone and, of course, as I said that first time in our stadium 9 years ago: Hala Madrid!",2018-07-10 16:19:44,0

2018,7,"[Di Marzio] Cristiano Ronaldo, Juventus is ready to close the deal",2018-07-05 16:09:36,7049,1336,"Cristiano Ronaldo-Juventus , the market dream can become reality . The Bianconeri are awaiting news from Jorge Mendes, who must now confirm the amount to be paid to Real Madrid for the Portuguese starter: EUR 100 million  to bring him to Italy.

Not an exible clause, 'alla Higuain' to be clear, but a gentlemen agreement between CR7 and Real Madrid. Jorge Mendes, during the meeting with Florentino Perez, reiterated his willingness to leave . And now, as mentioned, Juventus waits for the conditions of the transaction to be confirmed, both in terms of the total amount and the payment terms.

So the next developments are expected from Spain. If Real Madrid does not stop and respects the commitment to leave Ronaldo for the 100 million agreed, Juventus is ready to enter the scene officially. The bianconeri would then formalize the offer to the Spanish club, putting in writing the contract for the Portuguese champion: CR7 would earn 60 million gross for the next 4 years.

Agnelli's ok to the whole operation has already arrived , the Juventus president has had a thorough study of costs and revenues of the entire operation Cristiano Ronaldo . The Juventus plan is already ready, now we expect the signal of Jorge Mendes to put it into action.

Only then will the real operational phase begin, with Marotta and Paratici who meanwhile are still in Milan and have not planned any day trip to Madrid. But the Juventus market team waits for the OK from Spain, now Juventus believes it and can really close the operation Cristiano Ronaldo",2018-07-05 16:09:50,4

He's got 3 or 4 years max, and the safest place for the 3rd title is juve.

It could have been PSG, but I really don't think Ronaldo would prefer PSG, since football on the pitch is not always the primal show. 

Also, he has a great chance of winning the CL with the 3rd different team.
He is not done yet, he is hungry as ever. He clearly is running for the records, and I truly respect his challenging mentality after so many consecutive victories and personal achievements.

Basically what it sais (rough translation/ summary):

- There are 2 questionnaires
- In one (from December 2009) Ronaldo answers that he did have consensual sex with her
- In the second one (from September 2009) which was send from a lawyer of Osório de Castro's chancellery to Osório and his colleagues, Ronaldo answers the question if she did scream or got loud during sex as followed: 
""She said stop or no several times. She said that she doesn't want to, but she has made herself available. Afterwards I apologized. But she never screamed.""



**Edit:** Now, the media lawyer of Ronaldo publicly declared that a ""takeover of the publication"" is unlawful. 

So they most likely don't want the story to spread in other magazines or online...

2018,9,Rape Allegations: American Woman Files Complaint against Cristiano Ronaldo,2018-09-28 12:07:26,9955,3395,"I want to add that DER SPIEGEL is one of the, if not **the** highest decorated newspaper/magazine in Germany, maybe next to Die Süddeutsche. They played a massive part in uncovering the Football Leaks scandal in 2017 and are a very trustworthy source, especially when it comes to investigative reporting.

As for why she's only now coming out with this story, she lists three reasons in the in-depth investigate piece, currently only available in German:

1. She has a new lawyer that claims that she couldn't be sued if she speaks up about this, despite taking the money out of fear in 2009.

2. The overall climate has changed, rape victims are trusted more ever since the MeToo campaign. It's also become more difficult for rapists to downplay claims.

3. She wants to know whether other women have also been sexually assaulted by Ronaldo.

Overall, the evidence is damning. First reports of this emerged in 2017 during the Football Leaks scandal, but back then Der Spiegel didn't succeed in getting the woman to open up about this. More evidence apparently emerged since then as well and the fact that Ronaldo didn't sue Der Spiegel for defamation back when the first reports emerged, are also somewhat telling.

You can read the complete investigate report in the upcoming SPIEGEL print magazine or here if you do a try-out test month: http://www.spiegel.de/plus/cristiano-ronaldo-opfer-kathryn-mayorga-und-dann-ist-er-auf-mich-drauf-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000159674385",2018-09-28 12:27:49,6

2018,9,Rape Allegations: American Woman Files Complaint against Cristiano Ronaldo,2018-09-28 12:07:26,9955,3395,"Could Ronaldo still face criminal charges?

This started as a reply above, but I thought it was interesting enough to merit a separate thread

The Nevada statute of limitations (SoL) for rape (sexual assault) in 2009 was four years (NRS § 171.085(2)). In 2015, Nevada extended it to 20 years. By that time, the previous four-year SoL had already expired for an alleged 2009 rape. As /u/Arctus9819 pointed out above, it would violate the Ex Post Facto clause of the US Constitution to apply this extension after the existing SoL had already expired.

However, per  NRS § 171.083(1), ""If, at any time during the period of limitation prescribed in NRS 171.085 and 171.095, a victim of a sexual assault \[or\] a person authorized to act on behalf of a victim of a sexual assault . . . files with a law enforcement officer a written report concerning the sexual assault or sex trafficking, the period of limitation prescribed in NRS 171.085 and 171.095 is removed and there is no limitation of the time within which a prosecution for the sexual assault or sex trafficking must be commenced.""

This law was passed in the 90s, so there is no potential issue of retroactive effect. Therefore, **the question is, did she file a written report with the police?** The old Der Spiegel article refers to a transcript of a call to the police, but it also says she did not want to give the perpetrator’s name to the police. That suggests she probably didn’t file a “written report.” However, it also says she went to the hospital for a rape kit and “In December 2009, \[Ronaldo's lawyer\] was informed that \[the victim\] planned to meet with a police officer -- and that the investigators also wanted to talk to her female friend, the witness.” “It is not known whether \[the victim\] filed charges after the examination at the hospital. The documents suggest that she may have distanced herself from the situation for fear of its possible consequences.” So it's possible that she did eventually file a written report. If so, Ronaldo could face criminal prosecution.

I tried to find the victim's new civil complaint for more details, but I could not find it in the Clark County or federal systems under her name. It may be sealed.

""The article is nothing but a piece of journalistic fiction.

""The alleged victim refuses to come forward and confirm the veracity of the accusation.

""The newspaper has based their entire narrative on documents which are unsigned and where the parties are not identified, on emails between lawyers whose content does not concern Cristiano Ronaldo and whose authenticity he cannot verify, and on an alleged letter that is said to have been sent to him by the so-called victim, but was never received by Cristiano.""

""The accusations reported by the De Spiegel are false and Cristiano Ronaldo will do everything in his power to react against these.

""An accusation of an act of rape is disgusting and outraging, and he will not allow it to hang over his reputation.""

If what he says is genuinely what he felt, then I can't express the amount of bewilderment I feel for his utter stupidity.

>A notice of **voluntary** dismissal was filed last month in Nevada state court. **The filing didn’t say whether the accuser had reached a settlement with the Portuguese soccer player.**

>The New York Times reported in March that Juventus, the Italian league champions, wouldn’t participate in the International Champions Cup in the U.S. this summer to avoid the risk that Ronaldo would be detained by authorities as part of a rape investigation.

>Ronaldo publicly denied the allegations and never filed a response to the lawsuit.

>Leslie Stovall, a lawyer representing the woman who sued Ronaldo, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the dismissal.

2019,6,Cristiano Ronaldo Rape Suit in Las Vegas Is Dismissed by Accuser,2019-06-04 23:56:06,4772,1180,"First things first it is important to note that a voluntary dismissal DOES NOT mean that this woman made up the accusations. That said it is also important to note that quite obviously this also means that Ronaldo will not be tried in a court of law. 

Rape is, unfortunately, one of the hardest, if not the hardest, crimes to secure a conviction. This case was never likely to lead to a conviction as an accusation made years after the fact unless there was video evidence or overwhelming evidence of another kind, will likely never lead to a conviction. It is likely that a certain amount of media pressure and the fact that it has become clear that there is no reasonable prospect of a conviction has made her decide to close the case. 

I don't know if Ronaldo is innocent. I would like to believe that he is but what is clear is that this woman could well have gone through a traumatic event and we cannot dismiss that. She is going to have a lot of people questioning her character and frankly a lot of shit heading her way and I can't imagine that is going to be easy for her. 

I think this is probably one of those situations where it is best to draw a line under the situation and move on without passing judgement on either party.",2019-06-05 00:18:41,14

2019,6,Cristiano Ronaldo Rape Suit in Las Vegas Is Dismissed by Accuser,2019-06-04 23:56:06,4772,1180,"This is my own conclusion: it was never a rape, here are some quotes from Der Spiegel that barely got mentioned:


'On the way to the elevator, she (Mayorga) raved to Jordan: What a night, what fun! At some point they said goodnight to each other.'

Jordan is her friend who was with her the whole time. Makes it even more unlikely gor me that Ronaldo would do that right then where there are other possible witnesses. Ronaldos cousin and two friends were in the jacuzzi too, at the time when Ronaldo and Mayorga were in the room inside.

Also there were a lot of incostistencies. The way Mayorga falsely described their first encounter in the club. The video that came up later showed the excact opposite, she seemingly couldn't get her hands off of him.

Plus according to Ronaldo she initiated the foreplay, Mayorga denied that, but according to the narrative Ronaldo didn't have a reason to lie, because it was all about creating a good defense strategy. 

Again Der Spiegel:
'There are, though, also discrepancies between this version and Mayorga's story, such as on the question as to whether she pleasured him with her hand. He says yes. She says no. He also speaks of foreplay in the bathroom.'",2019-06-05 07:49:03,3

1. Her new lawyer believed the previous payoff was illegal and invalid.

2. Mayorga was given courage and strength to stand up to Ronaldo by the #metoo movement.

3. She wanted to know if he had raped others, and would inspire them to come forward


A behind the doors agreement is a pretty disappointing outcome, but one thing is for sure, the wave of rape victims didn't come forward to accuse Ronaldo and that's worth noting. Essentially he was a 'rapist' for a year for seemingly no reason.",2019-06-05 00:31:59,5

Source: official police data from 2008 to 2016, that anyone can find online in big newspapers websites. 

You guys need to know that false accusations are a very serious thing for laws worldwide. If anyone could accuse anyone of anything, legal system would be a chaos. That's why every country sets a high standard of sanctions to these cases, and they use a team of psychologists and police to determine whether a sex assault report is true or no.

If this case went that far, its because definitely something happened. Even if it's Cristiano Ronaldo, we can't excuse him saying that girls fake to be raped by him to get his money. That's what people initially said about Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein. Those are excuses that make women under those circumstances feel even more miserable. And some day, one of those women may be your girlfriend, your sister or your daughter.

People can't claim that Ronaldo is innocent just because of this. He just has too many influence, money and power to go against him alone. Anyway, we can't prove anything, but I'm sad if this ends like this and not with a real court explanation of what happened.",2019-06-05 09:20:02,1

2020,9,Cristiano Ronaldo becomes first European player to score 100 international goals,2020-09-08 20:39:10,6379,721,"It isn't a surprise that most of the football world is of the belief that CR7 will outlast Messi. I say that with no shade. Messi is awesome, but he hasn't really been running around the pitch for the past 5 or so years if we're totally honest. He has become so reliant on Barca being adapted to him that his cardio has suffered. Literally just waits for the ball to come to him. On several occasions he was actually clocked at covering less ground that the goal keeper (true story on more than one occasion). Obviously Messi will never be as athletic as Ronaldo or as committed to his fitness, but this is why Messi will retire first: It is doubtful that outside of Barcelona, he will find a team and manager that will let him largely remain stationary while Xavi/Iniesti/Suarez/Neymar 2.0 or some bland version of them, does all the running and passes him the ball.

I was excited to see what he would do at Man City and feel bad that he's forced to stay, and if he doesn't leave he's always going to be remembered for retiring from the national team twice after losses and threatening to leave Barca after a loss. It isn't a good look. He's too far past it now to catch up to CR7 in terms of winning at 4 different clubs in different leagues, plus the national team (pretty bad Portugal team compared to star-studded Argentina), but at this stage, if Messi is going to close out his legacy sooner rather than later (i.e. within the next 3 years maximum as per the originally proposed Man City contract which actually had the remaining 2 years on the contract at New York FC), then he's gotta cut his losses now, take Barca to court if he must, and see how he fairs in England.

Not confident given his lacklustre Argentina performances. Don't think he can actually adapt to another team like Ronaldo, Zlatan, Seedorf, Brazilian Ronaldo, etc. and it's because he's had it so comfortable at Barca. Really concerned that once he leaves Barca and he is continuously turning in ineffective performances, it'll tarnish what has been a remarkable legacy. All things going well, he stays at Barca and keeps winning and can play the One-Club-Legend trope.",2020-09-09 12:16:36,0

The dude’s a literal machine, an exemplary athlete, a serial winner, he adds so much to the sport and sets the bar, along with Messi, at unimaginable heights. While sharing a lot of excellent footballing qualities with Messi, he also contrasts him a lot, which makes someone like me appreciate him even more,  seeing him excel in some areas Messi might lack in a little.

Michael Jordan is widely regarded as the GOAT, because of his insane productivity in his prime on Championships winning teams, and was a marketing phenomenom that propelled basketball brand worldwide as the sport's biggest icon.

But, his legacy as the GOAT is contested by decent argumentation, some say:

It's Bill Russell! Leader and best player of the NBA's greatest dinasty with 11 championships.
It's Wilt Chamberlain! The most productive and dominant player ever in comparison to his peers!
It's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar! 15-year prime winning championships, insane production and achieving individual accolades ever since he was a young player!

Guess what. Pelé is Michael Jordan. Pelé is Bill Russell. Pelé ia Wilt Chamberlain. Pelé is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

I hate Edson Arantes' guts. But Pelé is the reason coaches invented the holding midfielder role. The futile attempts of stopping Pelé's unparalled dominance over his peers laid some of the most fundamental tatical paradigms that reign nowadays.",2020-12-03 11:47:47,2

FIFA’s revenue reached a new high of USD 6,421 million, of which USD 5,357 million or 83% was delivered by the 2018 FIFA World Cup RussiaTM, the most profitable edition to date. FIFA’s revenue goes back into football
More than 81% of full-cycle investments (USD 4,360 million) were invested across the entire football community: through substantially increased development funding for FIFA members, as well as financial contributions to all participants at Russia 2018.
**Strong and sustainable financial position**
FIFA’s total assets amounted to USD 4,389 million (50% higher than at the end of the previous cycle), with 82% in the form of cash, cash equivalents and financial assets.
**Prepared for the future**
FIFA’s reserves also reached a new record level of USD 2,745 million, providing global football with a solid financial foundation from which to flourish.

Just for context. Potentially generation defining mistakes are let go because some countries don't have the infrastructure to implement VAR or goal line technology, while FIFA swims in **billions** of US dollars.",2021-03-27 22:34:48,4

Even with his age he is still an insanely good player and, with his lifestyle and dedication he still have a few good years in him. 

But there is not a lot of place he can end up. If he still wants to win more trophies he should go to PSG, they can pay him and with Mbappe, Neymar and him, they can win anything.
I do not see hi going back to England, winning another different trophy in France would be more attractive to him. 

And Germany there is only Bayern but they do t need him and he will be too expensive.

The only other destination are MLS or China where he’ll earn a fuckin LOT but this would mean the end of his career at the top level. 
And the last place where he could end up would be in Portugal, I would be the heart choice, but he would have to say goodbye to a tons of money and to his CL chances.

And he still have a few good years in his belt, the logical choice would be to go to PSG to win titles in another league and have a shot at the CL. If he only wants money he can go to MLS or China. Or, he can go to Portugal if he wants to play at home but then it’s less money and no chances at CL.",2021-05-28 14:01:13,0

It’s also not a yardstick to compare to any South American players who, yes, play much more competitive countries. Bolivia and Venezuela are the worst teams in s America and would beat most of his highest scoring against teams there. 

Respect the achievement. It’s legendary to even play that many games, let alone go from minute 1-90 trying to score as many as possible and breaking the record.

This comment by /u/freeinf gives proper context

https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/o6wb5o/cristiano_ronaldos_international_goals_by_opponent/h2v9p0h/

i think it's hard to compare COPA to the euros(and qualifiers). to quote the messi vs ronaldo site (because of course there is a site for that).

""The average official FIFA ranking of Ronaldo's opponents in competitive matches is 50.9, whereas the average ranking of Messi's opponents in competitive games is 34.9.

To illustrate this, Ronaldo's top 5 favourite opponents in terms of goals scored in competitive internationals are Lithuania, Sweden, Andorra, Armenia and Latvia, who between them have an average FIFA ranking of 101.2.

Messi's top 5 favourite opponents in terms of goals scored in competitive internationals are Ecuador, Paraguay, Venezuela, Uruguay and Panama, who between them have an average FIFA ranking of 43.2.""

But I too feel that is a little misleading because yes while Ronaldo has destroyed weaker sides, I also feel he has done well against stronger sides. I think the main thing to conclude is that Ronaldo does get to play more weaker teams overall, but that does not mean he isn't playing well (or worse than Messi) against the stronger teams.",2021-06-24 11:26:45,2

On top of that everyone’s acting like scoring penalties are easy and “a free goal”. Sure, that was definitely on display throughout this euro, where more penalties were missed than scored.

2021,8,[MEGATHREAD] CRISTIANO RONALDO,2021-08-27 13:40:11,6875,5804,"When news filtered through on Thursday evening that, to Manchester United’s horror, Cristiano Ronaldo really had agreed to join Manchester City, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer spoke with his inner circle and knew United had to act.

Solskjaer recognised that beyond the playing aspects for Pep Guardiola’s side across town, seeing Ronaldo pull on the blue shirt of City would have wider consequences for United. To allow a legendary United figure to turn out for their local rivals without a fight would damage the club in the eyes of current players, potential recruits, and supporters. Conversely, Solskjaer pictured the benefits re-signing Ronaldo could bring to his squad, one of the youngest in the Premier League, with his ultra-professionalism and elite pedigree.

Solskjaer placed a call to chief executive Ed Woodward with one aim — he wanted to know if United could do the deal instead. It was a quick conversation. Woodward agreed instantly and set about negotiating with Ronaldo’s Italian club, Juventus.

Meanwhile, the network of past United players and even their iconic former manager Sir Alex Ferguson went to work on Ronaldo himself. Ferguson is described by multiple sources as playing a “major role” over the 24 hours, phoning Ronaldo and using his good relationship with Jorge Mendes, the superagent, to aid United’s cause.

Rio Ferdinand is another who stepped in heavily, almost acting as a broker on behalf of United. Ferdinand had a passionate conversation with long-time United team-mate Ronaldo, who was genuinely inquisitive about the impact moving to City might have on his United legacy. Ferdinand was firm in counselling Ronaldo over the hurt seeing him joining City might cause, set against the joy that returning to Old Trafford would bring him and United fans.

Ferdinand is also close to Woodward and made sure United were informed over the financial details. He was still up at 1.30am, sending messages to get the deal moving.
In provocative social media updates on Friday afternoon, sunglasses shielded the bags under his eyes.

At the same time, Bruno Fernandes pressed his Portugal team-mate, Patrice Evra exchanged voicenotes with him on WhatsApp, and Solskjaer, who was still a senior player at United when Ronaldo first joined the club as a teenager in 2003, personally intervened too. It was an avalanche of affection.

By 1.15pm on Friday, when Solskjaer performed his media duties ahead of this weekend’s game against Wolves, it was clear that United felt their charm offensive had worked.

It is believed Ronaldo had given his word he was signing up for a second spell by 10.30am that morning.",2021-08-27 20:20:52,1

2021,8,Cristiano Ronaldo goal disallowed for offside 90+4',2021-08-22 18:27:19,2073,425,"I was asked to post this comment here:

Technology should not be in place to determine down to the millimeter whether someone is offside IMO.  It’s like in basketball when the defender slaps a ball away out of bounds.  The vast majority of the time the slap away is not 100% clean and the offensive player likely grazes the ball ever so slightly as it goes out.  Usually, unless it’s blatant, the ref sides with the offensive player in a sort of “spirit of the game” sense.  

When it’s so ambiguous such as this the tie should go to the offensive player IMO.  I was unaware that a finger or hand could contribute to an offside call, but in that case it should fall in that “spirit of the game” call like in basketball.  I want technology such as VAR or instant replay to assist in getting the call right—not, however, in optimizing the sport down to the millimeter that drives all the fun of it out.",2021-08-22 19:32:54,1

Jokes aside, fair play to Jesse too, got the poke back to him then hit the deck and covered his head to protect it just in case haha. Nevermind the Young Boys mistake, Jesse is making his own waves now. Cavani looked likely too when on, worked hard to keep a chance alive etc. Both Matic and Fred played a couple of nice balls forward too.

Look, we didn't play well we can't pretend like we did (except for De Gea, who was amazing), but I admire the gear turning up, the fight for the win at the end. I've been plenty critical of Ole, but he knew he needed the win tonight so he threw on the second striker, and left Ronaldo on, and it paid off. Positive risk is in our blood.

Fred with the great early cross, a leggy Telles doesn't deliver that first time I reckon. Lingard has just played the most extraordinary of 1-2s with the GOAT. Fucking FIFA goal right there.. a headed 1-2 through ball return to goat to slot home finesse shot R1 circle type shit.

2021,9,Explained: The allegations against Cristiano Ronaldo,2021-09-01 08:23:02,1373,1002,"- Der Spiegel in 2017 reported Ronaldo was alleged to have raped an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, during a holiday in Las Vegas in 2009.
- Ronaldo has strongly and consistently denied all accusations made against him.
- In the documents dated from September 2009 and seen by Der Spiegel, Ronaldo is quoted as saying “she said no and stop several times” during sex. He is also said to have apologised afterwards.
- In January 2010, Ronaldo’s legal team agreed to pay Mayorga an out-of-court settlement of $375,000 (£272,000) in return for her agreeing to never go public with the accusations.
- Mayorga is said to have been inspired to re-open the case owing to the #MeToo movement
- Las Vegas Police said in September 2018 that the case against Ronaldo had been reopened and that detectives were “following up on information being provided”
- Las Vegas Police re-investigated the crime in 2018 but had concluded that the claims could not “be proven beyond reasonable doubt”.
- Six months later, it was confirmed Ronaldo would not face charges of sexual assault.
- In April this year, UK newspaper The Mirror published details from court documents that showed Mayorga was claiming for substantial damages
- Ronaldo’s lawyers, according to the Associated Press, have since attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed after claiming that Mayorga’s lawyers had failed to disclose that hundreds of documents used were from the Football Leaks website
- A key aspect to Mayorga’s civil case is that the initial ordeal had left her “mentally incapacitated” when agreeing to reach the initial settlement for $375,000 in 2010.",2021-09-01 08:29:19,11

When he was at Juventus, the Der Spiegel reporting and Kathryn Mayorga attempting to have the criminal case reopened made it relevant again. We embarrassed ourselves with a statement defending him, but the investigation didn't go anywhere and now there's just a civil case against him.

There's nothing that is going to effect Ronaldo's ability to play for Man Utd. He's not going to be arrested and he's not going to be extradited to America to stand trial. There are always going to be questions hovering over his head about what really happened, but nothing is going to come of it except maybe him having to publicly pay Mayorga a lot of money.",2021-09-01 09:29:07,5

She said that she didn't want to, but she made herself available. The whole time it was rough, I turned her onto her side, and it was fast. Maybe she got some bruises when I grabbed her. (...) She didn't want to 'give it to me,' instead she jerked me off. I don't know any more exactly what she said when she was jerking me off. But she kept saying no. 'Don't do it' -- 'I'm not like the others.' I apologized afterwards.""

Idk why this is such a big deal atm. Yes it’s a terrible thing that’s being alleged, but they’ve admitted that they can’t prove beyond reasonable doubt and it will likely never go to court. 
Things like the leak that supposedly came out just seem a bit far fetched as and as far as evidence that can be proven in court there’s virtually nothing. 

It sucks if it did happen, but there’s nothing that can be done",2021-09-01 13:43:51,1

Obviously (if the allegations are true) the rape itself is sickening and he should be charged for it. 

But regardless of what happened I feel if you sign a deal with someone you kinda have to stick to it? Like I don't wanna see rich people paying people off in such a way but at the end of the day she agreed to it, if she wanted to seek justice she could have done it back then but she evidently valued the money more.

I know she's probably a real victim but coming out of the woodwork to accuse him after nearly a decade of silence just feels like she smells a bigger payday, hence why she's seeking to back out of her original deal (whilst keeping the money) and seeking further damages. 

If she wants to prove her convictions she could always pay back the money she previously took or something? It's never gonna happen ofc but in my eyes it's the only way she can show that money isn't her main motivation.",2021-09-01 15:17:43,1

1 - from one angle it looked like zouma got the ball. If this is what the ref thinks then VAR should overrule.

Not gonna teach all of them but few just top of my head;

-If defender has played the ball earlier that day, or week, or has intentions to play the ball, with natural body position he or she shall not be punished by penalty or yellow card (like this one)

-If manager of attacking team has not compliment the dresscode of defender he is allowed one tackle in the box per 20minutes untill the manager noticed the outfits

-Player who might own FIFA for PS5 has to accept ”no hanballs in the box” setting might be left on, accidently, but it will be fixed for them in the next home game (like West Ham did) 

-Asking for a penalty more than 3 times leads to penalty for other team, if they have behived well and not ask themselfs, if they have also asked both teams will be punished in the next game by awarding penalty to new opponent who hasn’t asked yet, if that team is also penalty listed, the punishment follows you to European competitions

-Talking about penalties in press will lead automatic penalty in cup final, title and relegation fights, when ever the team gets there, they will be punished. If the manager leaves the club, both club and manager will be punished for allowing shit talk, when ever the opportunity to do so rises

2021,12,Cristiano Ronaldo's pinned comment on Instagram,2021-12-01 06:20:45,3249,1072,"Cristiano's Messi-related inferiority complex with some of his quotes through the years:

November 2008: ""I’m the best player in the world, the second best player in the world and the third best player in the world. There are some more good players in the level behind me like Kaká, Torres and maybe Messi a bit, but I did all it takes to be the best.""

July 2009: ""I’m happy to be the most expensive player in the world. I worth 96M, others worth 0, perhaps. The price that was paid for me shows the difference.""

February 2011: ""I’m not going to answer the question, everyone already knows that I’m better than Messi.""

September 2011: ""They whistle me (on 'Messi, Messi' whistles to him in Spanish stadiums) because I’m better than their player. They’re envious. Those who does this are idiots. Everyone who likes football, likes Cristiano Ronaldo the most.""

June 2012, after being whistled & eliminated from Euros 2012:  ""You know where Messi was in those heights in South America last year? Do You know what he did? Do You know or you don’t? He was eliminated in Copa America in his own country. I think that’s worse, don’t you?""

December 2012: ""I should’ve won the last 3 Ballon d’Ors, but it doesn’t depend on me.""

February 2013: ""It doesn’t surprise me that Messi didn’t vote for me in the Ballon D’or, we know the reason."" Ronaldo never voted for Messi, while Messi did in some years.

August 2014 regarding to winning UEFA’s best player: ""If I didn’t win this award it wouldn’t surprise me, because nothing surprises me anymore after what happened with the Ballon d'Or in the prior years.""

When Messi won his 5th Ballon d'Or in 2015, Cristiano said: ""For me the European Golden Shoe is better than Ballon d'Or because it's won by your goals and not by votes. It's the best award out there"" Cristiano had more Golden Shoes that time. Today Messi has 2 more than him. 6 Golden Shoes.

January 2017, during Fifa Best award ceremony: ""I’m sorry for certain Barcelona people not being here, that’s speaks for itself, but I understand that."" Note: Barcelona had a crucial away game the next day. Also Cristiano boycotted most of the ceremonies he lost.

December 2018: ""Maybe Messi misses me. I played in England, Spain, Italy, Portugal, in the national team, while he is still in Spain. Maybe he needs me more. For me, life is a challenge, I like it, and I like to make people happy. I would like him to come to Italy one day."" Former teammate Ryan Giggs stated: ""Ronaldo is obsessed with being Messi, there are no two ways about it. Cristiano's latest comments about Lionel Messi prove I'm right. 'I did it in England, I did it in Spain, I'm going to do it in Italy. I did it with Portugal.' He thinks that will be his argument 'Am I better than Messi' ?""

September 2019: ""I want to win more Ballon d'Or than Messi. I deserve it. I think I have to have 6 or 7 or 8 to be above him.""

Speaking to L'Equipe, Cristiano’s sister Katia Ronaldo said: ""We don't want to talk about Messi inside the house. His name is banned.""",2021-12-01 07:53:22,19

2021,12,Cristiano Ronaldo's pinned comment on Instagram,2021-12-01 06:20:45,3249,1072,"Cristiano Ronaldo this year:🏆 Coppa Italiano.🏆 Italian Super Cup.⚽ Top scorer of the Euro Cup.⚽ Top scorer of the Italian Championship.⚽ Juventus top scorer in the 2020/21 season.⚽ Manchester United's top scorer for the 2021/22 season.🏅 He became the highest scorer in football history in official goals.🏅 He became the top scorer in the history of all the teams in the world.🏅 He became the top scorer and the greatest assist in Euro Cup history. 43 goals a year, 6 goals in 5 games in this Champions League, all decisive and a guy who, regardless of his age, continues to perform miracles and is the guy who impresses the world most often. They still put the man in 6th grade... Do you really think 5 guys made more than him last year? Never. He could fight for that prize easily and the fight would be good with Lewandowski who in individual numbers was incredible and Bayern had a better season than Juventus and has been having a quieter season than United but level the selection for example Cristiano was way better And the prize goes to whom? For Messi who only won Copa do Rei for Barcelona, hasn't scored a goal against Real Madrid since Cristiano left, missed in the big games of the season, won Copa America which was supposed to be 4 in 4 years and they do pretty much everything year. He didn't score in the final and not in the semifinals. And it's been a weak season for PSG individually. For Cristiano to win this award he has to be 300% unquestionable. It's no use scoring the most beautiful bike of the year, being champion of everything for a club, top scorer of everything and scoring a hat-trick in the World Cup, they still find a way to get his prize. Already with Messi it's the opposite. He can have a low season, way down they'll always find a way to favor him and give him the award. Steal. Dirt. Shame. It's just unfortunate, Who saw it, saw it Those who are intelligent enough know who deserve the truth. Receiving awards without deserving it, is false happiness, without pride. Regardless of those awards, CR7 will always be the best in history!

Why are people surprised by Ronaldo's Instagram comments? This dude 
literally launched an award, Dubai soccer, when he was losing all the 
individual honors to Messi. Looks like he might create another one.

He has ""won"" the Dubai soccer award 6 times. No one else has won it more 
than once. Also, there is a new category for him almost every year. For 
example:


Greatest media attraction in football, 2011 – Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid)

Fans Favourite Player, 2013 - Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid)

Marca Fans' Favourite Player, 2014 - Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid)

Leave out of the copy pasta that messi was top goal scorer of his league too, tied for top goal scorer at Copa America and was top assister at CA. The cups won by ronaldo have similar value to the one won by messi. Lie and say Copa America was played 4 times in 4 years, while was played 2 times in 5 years.

2022,2,[Goal] Six games without a goal is Cristiano Ronaldo's worst drought since 2009.,2022-02-12 14:34:34,5552,849,"2016/2017 flashbacks. People said literally the same shit, when he had similar stint, and especially after his bad game against Granada, when he presented Ballon d'or. People were laughing their asses off, ''best player in the world my ass'', ''absolutely done'', and so on. Basically the same thing as now.

You don't go from class player to ''absolutely finished'', in quarter of a season. He came to Utd and scored bunch of goals, important goals, why? Mentality. He came there after having somewhat good Euro (not humiliating exit), as an Serie A topscorer etc.  Things have changed a lot since then. Utd went from top place to potentially even missing out on EL, Ole got sacked, one of their rising stars got basically kicked out of the club and is awaiting jail sentence. And even with his national team, his team is on a brink of missing out on World cup, due to unfair referee decision, and lack of goal line technology (Serbian FA has no money for the technology, yet the qualification bonus Serbia got is going towards some kind of charity, and not towards introducing the necessary GL technology, hehe)

To think that all of that doesn't leave a mental and form impact on the team and Ronaldo himself is just plain stupidity. Yes, you can stay motivated and aim for the wins, but you can't just straight up lie to yourself. Players see that everything is close to being in shambles, that manager got sacked, results are not there, then the Greenwood thing... Of course it is hard to get back in form.

I never followed Utd before Ronaldo came back, but guess what. I don't see any difference. The image the club and its team has, haven't changed. It still is seen as a meme. The problem fluctuates from Van Gaal, to Mourinho, to Ole, to Ragnick, to Pogba, to Fred, to Lukaku, to Ronaldo and so on. I am on this sub since 2016, and all the time Utd was being memed by whole sub the same way as it is now. Literally ''the problem'' changes every month, depending on performances.

Apparently, people were thinking old Ronnie will fix all the Utd problems, but he can't do it singlehandedly, in a team game, who would have thought?

This and similar threads, are just place for people who have personal hate on Ronaldo to circlejerk into each other mouths saying how bad he is to each other. And not with constructive criticism, but with straight up hate. All the people who hated on him, because he managed to compete with Messi, are all overwhelmingly happy to see him finally decline, and they go off on him.

I held my dead daughter in my arms in 2018. It fundamentally changed who I am, my perception of life, the importance I placed on things. 

Cristiano and Georgina have an impossible situation. They need to find strength for their baby girl while mourning the loss of their baby boy. Every joy they experience with her will come with the reminder of what was ruthlessly stolen from them. It is going to be crushing.

I am absolutely devastated for them. My heart goes out to these complete strangers as so many complete strangers did for me. They are now part of a wonderful community, though one nobody would willingly choose to join. Infant loss is far more common than people realize, almost taboo in many cultures. That creates artificial isolation from support and love. I hope they can find comfort in the support of those who already started their journey on this path. It is a far more crowded road than many will ever understand.

Edit: I wanted to thank everybody for their comments to me. We are four years removed from our experience. Our rainbow baby was born in 2020, taking on her big sister’s first name as her middle. We are not healed (nor can one ever truly do so) but we have found a measure of peace and acceptance. 

If people are moved to help parents that find themselves in this situation, let me know and I’ll point you in the right direction. These programs are drastically underfunded. Financial support can be short for those that need to pay funeral expenses for a newborn as few (if any) people have planned for it.",2022-04-18 18:47:03,23

Unfortunately this is the reality for many mothers and fathers, this just happens to be a high profile case. 50% of pregnancies will fail, which means it is likely your mother, your sister, your aunts, your grandmothers, have lost a child in utero or as a newborn. It is understandably not something they like to speak about, but next time just remember to show an extra bit of gratitude to the mothers (and fathers) in your life.

I remember when Utd signed him, same year as Arsenal signed Reyes RIP, and thinking Arsenal had found the better talent. The stories of his teammates being in awe at Rinaldo's dedication and hard work, sounds like he never ever has cheat days, food, drink, application. 

We love players like Messi, Ronaldinho for their unbelievable talent but I also have love for these types of players who have absolutely maximised their abilities through graft and hard work.

This season's might be the worst for him mentally. He knows he made a bad choice going there and he knows the team doesn't have what it takes to do better and that he will be held as the main villain. Same in the NT. Also he dropped massively fisically but we can start to see that decline mentally as well. The way is being replying in Instagram to every little shit comment tells me that he's not in a good state.

He should had bought the kid a new phone, apologized at least in video and not in a worded post. He did wrong and he is a grown man, face the consequences and take responsability.

These ‘experts’ are paid to have this view. Ok the tide has turned on Maguire this year but there’s so many second raters there that are the real problem. The solution apparently is kane and zaha. Another £150m+ at least that will have terrible returns. United need to build for the future, offload a lot of their biggest earners, replace the aged with young, cheaper talent. Won’t buy immediate success but chasing that over the past 5+ years is what’s got them into this hole. The van persie signing even under fergie was the start of their demise as they pissed money up a wall for one last league title. As a Liverpool fan I find their misfortune hilarious and the fact they’ve seemingly learnt nothing from years of failure quite enjoyable. Thought they bucked the trend last year with the savvy ighalo signing but they’ve reverted to chasing stars, most of whom don’t want anything to do with a team that’s going to be in the europa league next year.",2022-04-23 18:20:42,0

Norwich are bottom of the UK Premier League and scored 20% of all this seasons away goals against Man Utd in this game! That is how shit Man Utd's midfield and defense are. 

Rolando, with help from Elanga and Telles, likely saved Utd from 8th (No Europe competition). 

Utd's totally incompetent captain and main defender, Harry MacGuire, kicked his own team member Paul Pogba in the head so hard it made him bleed, which led to Pogba having a breakdown on the pitch and smashing the pitch six times in a total rage against MacGuire's incompetence. Despite being played out of his position in defensive midfield, the fans booed him twice. Totally messed up.

Here me out, how does this not kill you as a sports fan.... 

Example you're team is in a 1-1 game at a  world cup match or some high level championship game and a play like the one Ronaldo had here happens, a penalty kick enuses and your team loses.

Now I understand there's a foul here but why the hell are these pretty much a guaranteed goal. Half the time the offensive player dives and fakes being taken out and he still gets a PK. I can't watch a sport where so much of the game, and who wins, can be dictated by a PK, makes zero sense to me.

Tuchel's system relies on pressing from the front, and Ronaldo is literally the worst forward in the league for this. It's not possible to build a legitimate pressing team with any dead weight, as you're immediately a man down in the press and it's not feasible to cover the necessary angles and passing lanes when pressing in on the defenders.

He's no longer able to beat his man, or offer much in terms of creation. His inaction also pushes a burden onto others around him to pick up the slack, at their own detriment (as with Sancho). The less said about his FKs the better.

So, he'd not only make Chelsea worse off on the pitch in many aspects, but he'd also break Chelsea's wage structure, and be incredibly difficult to shift. A real question mark on Boehlys aptitude for the necessary rebuild if this is transfer is pursued.",2022-07-04 13:45:01,0

Maybe Chelsea would pay his wages, but I can’t see him going back to Real Madrid or anywhere else in Spain either.

But I do find it funny that he forced a move away from us in the last year of his contract and then it went completely tits up at Man Utd, if he had stayed with us for one more year he’d be a free agent right now and be getting plenty of lucrative two year deal offers which he could take his time deciding on.

If Man Utd don’t have a quality striker in their sights, and it’s hard to see any established goalscorers they could attract right now, they have to say ‘Tough shit, you’re staying’, or ten Hag’s first season in charge will become significantly more challenging than it already was going to be.",2022-07-02 15:27:04,1

>Chelsea have decided not to make any attempt to sign Cristiano Ronaldo this summer as a replacement for Romelu Lukaku. 

>New co-owner Todd Boehly met with Ronaldo’s agent Jorge Mendes in Portugal last month and the possibility of acquiring the forward was one of many subjects discussed.

>Speculation about a possible move to Stamford Bridge has increased after the 37-year-old made it clear to Manchester United that he wants to leave for a Champions League club. He has not travelled on their pre-season tour either, citing ‘family reasons’.

>Chelsea allowed Lukaku, who they signed for a club record £97.5 million last summer, to rejoin Inter Milan on a season-long loan at the end of last month, meaning there was possibly room for Ronaldo to come in.

>However, The Athletic understands that the club will not be making a bid for the Portugal international, who scored 24 goals for Manchester United last season.

>Chelsea have completed the £47.5 million signing of Raheem Sterling this week and he is being earmarked to be a major focal point of Chelsea’s frontline.

>The club also have a number of other options to choose from who can play in attacking positions including Kai Havertz, Timo Werner, Christian Pulisic, Mason Mount and Callum Hudson-Odoi.

>Talented youngster Armando Broja, who is wanted by the likes of West Ham United, Newcastle United and Everton, was on the same flight as Sterling to Los Angeles and has begun training with the squad.

KDB is one of the very best players in the world and Pep doesn’t change anything to accommodate him.

- Raphina? A good player, but where is he going to play when we already have Mount and James on the right? Are we changing the formation and moving Mount to midfield? Not sure if I like that.
- de Jong? Sure, I can see him as a long term option for the midfield with Jorginho and Kante getting older and at the end of their contracts. Would a Kova & de Jong double pivot work tho?

2022,7,Chelsea ready to make 16.5M€ offer for Cristiano Ronaldo,2022-07-08 09:55:40,4257,720,"Can someone honestly explain to me why this would be a good deal for United? We don't have a replacement yet, so as things would stand if we sold Ronaldo we would be playing with martial as our only striker (if you say we have Rashford I will ignore you). Let us say we find a replacement, who is it going to be? Whoever you name I can't imagine scoring close to 20 goals this incoming season with our lineup so this is starting to look really bad from all the perspectives.

imo: I trust Ronaldo scoring 20 goals next season more than united getting a good replacement who scores 20 goals (not saying any of this will happen but this is where I would put my money on).Rather keep Ronaldo and buy another striker if we can or sell Ronaldo outside the PL only IF you can get a replacement, don't sell him to a rival we (hopefully, at best) will be battling for a top 4 spot

He’d go in generate a bunch of money shirt sales, brand deals and his fans. Score 20+, cement his records. Bring nothing to the table but hatricks against Fulham and drawing back the younger players. He would have such a bad effect on guys like havertz. He will be the center of every attack and the whole team will rely on him therefore drawing us back. He will play a year then leave the team in a bad spot. You see guys like mason mount scoring bangers most of the times that won’t happen because now he has to provide to ronaldo. TT doesn’t want him and we don’t need a old superstar on our team who will do nothing other than score a lot of goals and draw the team back 2 years. He doesn’t fit our system which doesn’t create a lot of chances he’d fit bayern liverpool and city who create tons of chances. As some of us chelsea fans we have to accept that we don’t compare to city and liverpool and ronaldo wouldn’t solve that problem. We saw what happened with our last striker signings all flopped. 

All in all ronaldo will just draw the team back and cement his records and score a bunch of goals. I’m not disrespecting him he’s the greatest goal scorer but not a chelsea fitting player.",2022-07-09 01:09:38,0

Also 3,5mln net salary because I dont believe he's better than Rebic(Im sorry Im just huge fan of this croat warrior) so he cant earn more than him.",2022-08-14 12:10:30,0

Been the arse end if criticism ever since uniteds form dipped. He's the only reason they made it through to the knock out stages of the ucl. He's the only reason they beat atalanta, villarreal etc. Scored 18 goals in the league.

You sign ronaldo and you know what your getting yourself into, a player who will score you goals but won't do anything else apart from that. If you wanted someone who's fast and can press and get goals then you can get yourself one of the younger players not 38 year old Cristiano ronaldo.

It's going to taint his legacy a little. Came back to the club that saved them to win the league after 10 years and instead He's blamed for all their short comings. I get it ronaldo can be a bit imposing sometimes and has an ego but when a 5 time balon dor (1 if which was with your club) winner 5 time UCL winner (one of which was with your club) speaks you listen regardless of you who are. He's done things no one else will ever do and accomplished so much. It makes sense that it all collapsed when he joined the whole united team seem to have massive egos and when someone with a fat ego joined and those egos collided it all went to shit. These players really do think they're something special. None of these players deserve a place on the starting 11 if I was ten hag i would be playing all the youngsters every single game.

https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/21/manchesterunited.premierleague1



> First of all a little story to tell you what kind of man we are talking about. It is January 9, 2008, and in an upstairs room at Manchester United's training ground five elderly men in smart blazers are struggling with their emotions in front of a hushed audience. It is the club's media day building up to the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster and Sir Bobby Charlton's polite smile does not hide the fact he is trembling as he takes his seat. Bill Foulkes is straight-backed and dignified but only a couple of questions have been asked before the tears appear in his eyes and he reaches for a glass of water.


>In an adjacent room Wayne Rooney has agreed to offer a modern-day perspective of that seminal day when 23 people, including eight members of Sir Matt Busby's team, were killed in the wreckage of the burnt-out BEA Elizabethan. It is not his specialist subject but he handles the occasion with dignity and more eloquence than some people might imagine. But then Cristiano Ronaldo comes through the double doors and the mood is broken.


>He is wearing a white suit jacket and ripped jeans, looking every bit the boy-band hunk, but it is very obvious he is in a bad mood. He begins by berating Karen Shotbolt, the club's press officer, because he is waiting for Rooney and the event has over-run. He is banging his watch with his hand, flapping his arms and gesturing in the way that Portuguese footballers usually reserve for fussy referees and, at first, he is so animated it appears as if it might be a wind-up.


>When he flounces back through the doors, cursing loudly, it is very obvious he is being deadly serious. Rooney is professional enough to carry on with his tribute but the attention is no longer exclusively on him. Thirty seconds later Ronaldo appears again, first rapping his forefinger against the glass in the door, then opening it by a fraction and starting to whistle at Rooney in the way that a farmer beckons his sheepdog.


>It was such an unpleasant scene the journalists decided not to write about it because we had been invited to the training ground to cover a far more important subject and, when you have sat with men as noble as Charlton, Foulkes, Albert Scanlon, Harry Gregg and Kenny Morgans and seen the hurt in their eyes, it felt incongruous to veer off-track.",2022-10-20 20:31:09,10

- Pouts in games when he doesn’t score and brings the vibe down 
- Now refused to be subbed on and walks out on the team twice in a season 

Yeah he was incredible in his first tenure but we were also an incredible team. SAF won premier leagues and the champions league without him, I’m sure he would have won anyway in the 00s.

He's got that winning mentality. For him to get benched more games then not must be rough, especially after the legacy he's established. I think we all know that. But that doesn't at all justify his behavior. I think he's struggling to come to terms with the fact that he's getting old and it's inhibiting his performance and that's why he's reacting in  such a way. His action was wrong but I understand him.

I think if he wants to leave a good legacy after retiring, he's going to need a reality check and start acting like the player he is. He's old, he's slow, and he doesn't have the same finesse as he used to. Every person at a point in their lifetime comes to terms with their age.

For all the talk about how professional he is and what a good influence he is on youngsters, this showed his true colours that he's all about himself and doesn't give a shit about the team.

I've known this, really, since the '08 CL final. The media billed it as ""Messi v Ronaldo"" and Ronaldo treated it like it actually was - barely ever passing, dribbling down blind alleys and shooting wildly whenever he could see the goalposts.

Back then, though, he was good enough to get away with being a selfish prick. Now he's not, he's 37 and all that's left is his massive ego. I don't even care if we pay him off.

But this is also on the club, they didn’t want to sell him during the summer transfer window when he wanted a move and ETH said Ronaldo was important in the plans.

2022,10,Man Utd club statement on Cristiano Ronaldo following Tottenham match | Manchester United,2022-10-20 16:48:48,2472,599,"Ten hag will never win this battle with Ronaldo. 

There are far more Ronaldo fans than there are ten hag fans and that ultimately will get him the chop.

At the end of the day Ronaldo in a poor team last year was top goalscorer for anyone to say his powers have dwindled are clueless. 

He's not had the game time and when you watch these games there are certain players who refuse to pass the ball to him in forward positions when it's better to square it for a goal or look for him instead of taking on audacious shots.

Rashford Sancho are the 2 biggest for not giving him the service this season. There's definitely an agenda in that united squad the ones who do find Ronaldo are dalot Fernandes and Casemiro and ull see how we suffer as a result because they are over trying to get him involved.

Casemiro showing form now but why did he not walk into that team when every prick knew United's biggest problem in the summer was midfield the day he signed the next game he should of been a starter and get him settled into the team early but nope we lost many many games instead.

We played against a poor spurs team that win last night ... Why we getting carried away? Look what happened against city... 6-1 and they conceded silly goals at the end...if they didn't play around with us that game was a 10+ goal game. Spurs typically bottle it at old Trafford so them losing to us and same as arsenal doesn't change anything with our current position. Against better teams we will get found out again and again.

Against Newcastle Ronaldo would have scored that late Rashford header the fact we took him off shows the lack of urgency to get a result. 

Firmly on team Ronaldo. He should of been let go in the summer and the fact they kept him he should be starting every game, give him enough chances and he'll score 30+ a season doesn't matter his age. Last year was his poorest season for over a decade and yet he still outscored everyone in that united team and most teams around the league. What does that tell you? He's shit?

I think usually when he suffered emotionally or mentally he relied on football to make himself feel better, it was something he could control. 
Losing his child and then not having game time to focus on was a terrible combination. Would be for any pro footballer I imagine. 
But you also have to consider Ronaldos ego problem, which is apparent to everyone (to an extent it’s understandable, look at him and what he’s achieved-of course he has an ego).

He shouldn’t have said what he said about Ten Hag and I bet in time he will regret it. So far besides that I don’t see too much wrong with the interview.

More than anything else he needs a friend to tell him the truth and I’m not sure he has that.

>""I don't have respect for him because he doesn’t show respect for me.""

Other:

>He (SAF) knows better than anybody that the club is not on the path they deserve to be. He knows. Everyone knows. The people who don’t see that… it’s because they don’t want to see; they are blind.”

My theory is that the club (in August probably) knows that Ronaldo will give potentially damaging interview for the club. The club may not know the exact contents but tried to make Ronaldo to hold the interview by giving him match starts and captanicy. However, both sides cannot stand each other anymore and agreed if the interview will come out, it should be after Fulham match. The ""illness"" excuse possibly agreed to keep lid on matters until now. 

The interesting part is that why the relationship with EtH broke down completely. Quite possibly EtH questioned that Ronaldo's child to be sick in July. This leads to Ronaldo feeling disrespected. I think EtH may think he made a mistake about not trusting Ronaldo so try to repair the relationship with Ronaldo by giving starts and captaincy. However, Ronaldo is already hurt already. 

I totally disagree with total disrespect of Ralf Rangnick though. 

However, I am totally agree with Ronaldo comments regarding how the clubs are run by the glazers. I am looking forward what he will say about the glazers.

2022,11,What's going on with Cristiano Ronaldo?,2022-11-22 17:40:53,2460,154,"Answer: Some great responses here but just want to simplify for folks who may not be aware of how the football world works and just want a high-level understanding of the scenario.

Ronaldo played at Manchester United from 2003-2009 and is considered a legend of the club (aka team). He eventually left to play in other leagues  - but has always been revered by United fans and is considered one of the GOATs (greatest of all time) in football.

Ronaldo is 37. Well above the average age of an elite footballer. But he still plays well - just not as well as he used to. Last year, he expressed that he’d like to leave the club he’d been playing for and join a new one. Worth noting he’d been underperforming at that club as well.

After rumors started swirling that he was considering a move to United’s rival club, United swept in and signed him seemingly overnight. Most United fans were very excited. Others were skeptical due to his age and increasingly poor attitude.

Ronaldo was being paid £500k a week at United (a very high wage even by football standards), but did not play in many important games and was rarely a starter. He often sat on the bench and came on as a sub for other players. He has shown a poor attitude both on the pitch and in the locker rooms toward other players and especially toward United’s new manager (aka coach).

He made it clear earlier in the year that he wanted to leave United, but no other club wanted him due to his massively high salary, degradation in skill, and general negative attitude.

He went on Piers Morgan to express his disdain for the club, its owners (to be fair, no one likes the owners), the state of the stadium (everyone agrees it’s in need of massive improvements), the manager, and more. Most people think he did this intentionally to get out of his contract. Either way, he and United “parted ways” earlier today. United did not have to pay any money to terminate the contract and he’s now free to go elsewhere.

Many United fans are very happy because this means the club now has freed up money to put toward bringing in new players. 

Additionally, it was announced today that the Glazers (the aforementioned owners who have been hated and protested by United fans for years), announced they’re open to selling the club. Some are seeing the Ronaldo failure as playing a part in that decision.",2022-11-23 05:40:35,1
2022,11,What's going on with Cristiano Ronaldo?,2022-11-22 17:40:53,2460,154,"Answer: Although he did criticize the owners, he didn't just leave it at that. He was dismissive and said he doesn't respect Eric Ten Hag (current Manchester United manager). This is a big deal seeing as how this coach was appointed over the summer to slowly turn things around at a struggling United. The coach has been making slow but steady improvements to the team. 

One thing that has been noticeable from the team under the new manager was how well they played when Ronaldo was not in the team. This is almost indisputable really, but from the statements Ronaldo gave in the interview it seems he does not believe this, and thinks he should still be the focal point of the team. 

During the interview he did criticize the owners which is a valid point among Manchester Untied fans, who have been protesting the owners at various games and throughout the last few seasons. Despite maybe resonating with the fans, this may have rubbed the owners the wrong way. 

Additionally this interview is really the (admittedly big) tip of the iceberg of his recent actions at the club. 

* After last season and before the preseason, he publicly said that he wanted to leave. The manager said he wanted to keep him, and also no viable offers came in for him that would allow him to leave. So he was still a Man Utd player.
* During preseason he and 7 other players left a friendly preparation game early (i.e. before the game ended), this is not usual. It is also extremely dismissive of a new coach. The players were not punished for this but the manager did say he does not approve.
* During a game in which United were 2-0 up against Tottenham the manager wanted to bring on Ronaldo from the bench with 5-6 mins to go and he refused and walked off the pitch. The coach punished him for this.

There is probably a more refined list but these are the main points that led us to him being fired. They say mutual termination but it really is more of a firing.",2022-11-22 18:09:28,1

Ronaldo has a legitimate claim to be one of, if not the, goats but he's shown with this interview that he's a negative presence in the dressing room and a lot of what we're doing well stems from a unit that's working together.

I don't think he'd like being benched for Wilson either.

As well as ETH trying to build a team that a 37/38 year old just can't be in a longer term plan going forwards Ronaldo is frustrated by that.

Ronaldo feels he should be the main man as he was last season and his numbers do back this up, but hes distracted.

A lot of the stuff Ronaldo has said is stuff that pundits, journalists and fans have been saying about us. I think the only major divergence is that he views someone saying he hasn't been playing well enough as a disrespectful attack on him rather than it being an honest appraisal (this being because he has an intergalactic ego). 

The guy is clearly frustrated, and he's throwing his weight around in an attempt to end the situation he's in one way or another. Is it the right thing to go about it? No, clearly not. Will it work? Probably, becuase the liklihood he plays for us again now is tiny. Will it be good for the club in the long term? I actually think the answer to that one is yes.

There is stuff to analyse and talk about in this mess beyond ""Ronaldo is bang out of order"". I'm a little bored of this surface level reaction. Yes he's out of order.... What else? Contrary to popular belief there is more that can be said about this here imo and I'm kinda interested to hear it.

I hardly ever agree with Carragher but he's right, Ronaldo wanted to leave but no club seriously wanted to take him and he also missed pre-season, so obviously it doesn't make sense for ETH to try and build a team with his philosophy with a 37 year-old player who won't be here next season. 

Even then despite all the drama from his narcissistic tantrums, ETH still handled Ronaldo respectfully, had words with him and didn't freeze him out. Ronaldo wouldn't have dared do that to SAF and it's a shame that he didn't learn that no player is bigger than the club from him. I admit I would have liked Ronaldo to be given more game time around the start of the season to allow him to try and capture his form from last season but even when he's played he's not been good, not even just a form thing but a lack of effort too, add that to the fact that we've played better without him and you can't justify giving him anything more.

Ronaldo came back expecting to be the main man again and for a period of time he was.

Unfortunately he isn't 25 or 30 years old anymore and he can't play every minute of every game. We also don't have the players to carry him, so for certain games he isn't the right man to lead the line anymore.

Ronaldo can't or just simply won't accept this, so now there's a problem.

This isn't about sacking Ole or bringing in Ralf.

It's not about the facilities or lack of development, it's about Ronaldo being told no for the first time in probably the last decade.

Cristiano Ronaldo quotes: 

>""Yes [he's being forced out]. Not only the coach, but another two of three guys around. I felt betrayed.""

> ""People should listen to the truth. Yes, I feel betrayed and I felt that some people didn't want me here [at #mufc], not just this year, but last year too.""

On Rangnick

>“If you’re not even a coach, how are you going to be the boss of #mufc? I’d never even heard of him.

>""A big club like Manchester United bringing in a sporting director like Rangnick surprised not only me but all the world.This guy is not even a coach.""

On Ten Hag

> ""I don't have respect for him because he doesn’t show respect for me.""

On Wayne Rooney

>“I don’t know why he criticises me so badly, probably because he finished his career and I’m still playing at high level. I’m not going to say that I’m looking better than him, which is true..."" 

>“I’m not going to say that I’m looking better than him. Which is true . . . ”

On his return

>“The progress was zero, since Sir Alex left, I saw no evolution in the club. Nothing had changed.”

>""Nothing changed [at #mufc]. Not only the jacuzzi, the pool, even the gym. Even some points of technology, the kitchen, the chefs - who I appreciate, lovely people! I thought I would see different things, technology, infrastructure.""

Other:

>He (SAF) knows better than anybody that the club is not on the path they deserve to be. He knows. Everyone knows. The people who don’t see that… it’s because they don’t want to see; they are blind.”

>“I think the fans should know the truth, I want the best for the club. This is why I come to Manchester United.

>“But you have some things inside that don’t help (us) reach the top level as City, Liverpool and even now Arsenal . . . a club with this dimension should be top of the tree in my opinion and they are not unfortunately.”

>""I love Manchester United, I love the fans, they’re always on my side. But if they want to do it different… they have to change many, many things.”",2022-11-13 22:03:28,19

Yes. Before people say it, I know there have been signs of his character for many, many years. Still.

Criticising actions and criticising decisions is one thing. Even if I think Ronaldo is flat-out wrong those are still just matters of perspective.

All he did was call Wayne ugly, though. In some magical world where Ronaldo is right in all this, that alone will always be wrong, and is a sign of a rotten personality.

Wayne, however, has grown up. The crazy, unfaithful, troublesome mad kid that he once was is now a grown man who seems to have put his past behind him (I hope) and is now a respected, emerging manager.

People are letting the hype of the World Cup plague the reality of the comparison between the two players. I’m not saying one is better than the other. 

Ronaldo absolutely dominated every single league he played in, broke and then set utterly insane scoring records. He holds every single scoring record in the history of the UCL. He did a “threepeat” in the UCL. He played in Spain, Italy, and most importantly, the most difficult and most demanding league in the  English Premier League. He won the Euro’s. When he plays internationals he competes against the top teams in the world. He could score anywhere inside 30 yards with either feet and is absolutely lethal in the air. He is also an unreal athlete. 

Messi grew up in a softer league than what Ronaldo grew up in. He walked into a system built specifically for him, playing with players he played with since he was young, and was absolutely spoiled by two of the greatest midfielders in Xavi and Iniesta for years. As soon as Ronaldo hit Spain it wasn’t such a cake walk for Messi anymore. He plays for objectively the best or second best team in South America. The quality of players he has around him is always higher and the level of competition is always lower for Messi than it has been for Ronaldo at the international level. When Messi went to France, a league so soft it’s considered a “Farmer’s League” he struggled to dominate there. He’s also not as two-footed and is half the athlete that Ronaldo is. 

Ronaldo is statistically the greatest goal scoring player of all time. Messi is the media’s golden boy and has always had favorable narratives working for him. Ronaldo is not likable no doubt, but he has irrefutably played a more challenging career. Messi never played in the top league and took a step down when he went to France. Ronaldo started in the greatest league of all time, went to Spain, and then Italy.  

I say all this to educate the angsty teenagers who are using the hype of the World Cup and their dislike for Ronaldo off the pitch to alter the reality of the comparison. We’ll never see a player like Messi, or Ronaldo again. Messi is a footballing genius of the absolute highest caliber and has broken and set some incredible records himself.

To answer the post I think Ronaldo is very close to Messi, he's has also represented more clubs and has thrived every single time until now.

Messi has played for Barcelona since he was 13(?) And you could see his performances dropped once Xavi and Iniesta left/retired.

After that he should have kept his head down and understood it would probably be for the best rn to start from the bench for United while trying to get in-form, but instead he decided to think the whole world is against him and do the Piers interview right before the World Cup. He put too much pressure and attention on himself with that move and then you'd have his sisters and other public figures go onto social media to talk about how ""ungrateful"" the Portuguese are just because we had the audacity to say he shouldn't be starting rn. Didn't help that the news would just keep focusing on the Ronaldo controversy here. For as much as he has been making an ass of himself I still feel sorry tho, hated seeing him cry at the end of the game yesterday and just didn't like seeing him so ineffective in the World Cup, hopefully he can find a second wind and get back in form by working harder and being more humble regarding his status as a potential bench player. He'll always be the GOAT when it comes to Portugal.

Ganhar um Mundial por Portugal era o maior e mais ambicioso sonho da minha carreira. Felizmente ganhei muitos títulos de dimensão internacional, inclusive por Portugal, mas colocar o nome do nosso país no patamar mais alto do Mundo era o meu maior sonho.

Lutei para isso. Lutei muito por esse sonho. Nas 5 presenças que marquei em Mundiais ao longo de 16 anos, sempre ao lado de grandes jogadores e apoiado por milhões de portugueses, dei tudo de mim. Deixei tudo em campo. Nunca virei a cara à luta e nunca desisti desse sonho.

Infelizmente, ontem o sonho acabou. Não vale a pena reagir a quente. Quero apenas que todos saibam que muito se disse, muito se escreveu, muito se especulou, mas a minha dedicação a Portugal não mudou nem por instante. Fui sempre mais um a lutar pelo objectivo de todos e jamais viraria as costas aos meus companheiros e ao meu país.

Por agora, não há muito mais a dizer. Obrigado, Portugal. Obrigado, Catar. O sonho foi bonito enquanto durou… Agora, é esperar que o tempo seja bom conselheiro e permita que cada um tire as suas conclusões.

Yeah, yeah, he’s earned an absolute king’s ransom to go there and that’s amazing for him and Mendes, so well done, but from a sporting aspect, this couldn’t have been played any worse. 

I’ll assume that the plan was to have him nuke his contract with United, play astonishingly well with Portugal and then get a move to a massive European club, who would be practically falling over themselves just to have him. 

In the end, he’s almost certainly tarnished a huge part of his reputation at Manchester United, he majorly disappointed at the World Cup, where he not only showed the same level of petulance and unprofessionalism as what got him chucked out of United in the first place, but now he’s been replaced in the national side and no top European club will touch him with a ten-foot barge pole.

I get time catches up to everyone but I think even seeing him in the MLS would've been preferable, at least that league is pretty competitive and getting better. Frankly, I don't care how well Al-Nassr does, I don't think I could name 2 other teams in that league.

Cristiano Ronaldo will play for Al-Nassr from January 1. The contract that links the Portuguese footballer with the Saudi team will last two and a half seasons, as announced last week. The striker ended his relationship with Manchester United two days before starting his participation in the World Cup in Qatar, being able to negotiate with any team, being Al-Nassr the one that showed more interest from the beginning.

The contract, in addition to the hefty fee (just under one hundred million euros) is surrounded by economic incentives via advertising, which will place the Portuguese as the highest paid athlete in the world. The total amount of CR7's contract with Al-Nassr will be close to 200 million euros per season.

Messi, Neymar at PSG are the heads of the soccer cartel, but their 75 and 70 million that they charge per season fall far short of what Cristiano Ronaldo will receive in Saudi Arabia. Even going through the list of the highest paid in the United States, they all fall far short of the money promised to the Portuguese.

Cristiano Ronaldo will find himself in a team that is looking to regain its lost dominance in its competition, far from the world's top level. The step backwards he is taking in sporting terms is evident, but his soccer is gradually placing him at another competitive level. They are even receiving criticism in Portugal for their performance during the World Cup, something unthinkable months ago.

In Al-Nassr he will be coached by the Frenchman Rudi Garcia and will have the Cantabrian Alvaro Gonzalez as a teammate. The central defender arrived in Saudi soccer last summer after finishing his time in France. The presence of Ospina also stands out. The Colombian goalkeeper finished his contract with Napoli and decided to accept the Saudi proposal. Real Madrid had him in the orbit as long as Lunin had left the white discipline, something that did not happen.",2022-12-05 11:47:32,2

Maybe it’s a weird drastic physical decline, maybe it’s personal/ family reasons, maybe it’s losing love for the game, maybe it’s all of those. 

I’ve watched every Man United game this season. He un-debatably makes them worse. Even with Portugal. They’re actually trying to attack in a fast manner for the first time under Santos’ reign and he hinders most of that.

They have to do a lot of his work defensively and in the build up. The team serves him and not the other way around. It’s all for his own personal glory and ego.

You can disagree with that and dispute it. That’s fine. But for me, it’s wrapped up perfectly with the way Portugal has handled free kicks. CR7 has very below average direct free kick stats. He’s made a couple of bangers over the years, sure, but his overall % is bad and has gotten worse as he’s gotten older. He can’t possibly be the most consistent free kick taker on the team, but he’s still the one kicking them into the wall or into the stands every time. 

So yeah, Portugal is better without CR7 and it isn’t all to do with his physical ability.",2022-12-08 07:12:42,0

Portugal won a game without Ronaldo, where does this concept come from? Why to talk about this and why not for the good game everyone played that day? Haters and media are always like this, they just talk about what they are jealous or afraid of, instead of talking about positive vibes they just talk the bullshit stuff (am sorry! but they dont deserve any better word than this).   


Same day there was another game, Morocco vs Spain, nobody is gossiping about Spain the 2010 champions who even cant hit a single penalty shoot on target in a knockout game, no one talks on that because no one hates them, so everyone talks about Morocco won, they made a history they are the dark horse team of this tournament.   


These double standard people who just love to spread negative energy and vibes everywhere are the most pathetic creature on earth and I really don't know who is this person Herculez Gomez, what is he? Does he play for a club or he is a referee in children street football game?  
If you hate someone hate them alone, dont hire an army or force or distract others to do so.   


legends are always respected, when they play good we applause and now at the end of someone's career we start hating him for what?? Dont forget what he has done for his country and team, the maturity in the team is because of him, his existence in the game is enough. Only those who have zero sports vibes will talk negative and follow the crowd.

It's get tiring constantly hearing it when as a fan I know it's not true. It's not his fault but it's like the ball magnetizes to him too much when he plays and our attack becomes less diverse. Man has aged and can't go 1v11 anymore. Nor does he need to!

2022,12,Are Portugal better without Cristiano Ronaldo?,2022-12-07 08:29:09,854,430,"Yes.

Players such as Ronaldo have spent the good part of their careers playing in teams that are literally built around them. This generally only works to that teams' advantage when that hyper-centered player almost always scores 1 or 2 goals per game.

Sweden did not have Zlatan in their squad for the WC18 qualifiers nor the tournament itself - and the team felt a lot more balanced than it had in a while and we actually made it to the damn QFs, which was the best WC performance in decades. I can see similar things happening with Portugal in the near future if they start benching him more frequently.

&#x200B;

At their primes, these players are ''luxury players'' that do not press, don't really do much of anything outside of the offensive third, but are so damn good at scoring goals and coming in clutch that it is still worth centering the entire team around them.

**On the flip side**, when these players start declining, they become liabilities. They become non-pressing players in an increasingly press-demanding game, which demand a level of status and focus from the team which they can't really justify with their pitch performances anymore.",2022-12-07 21:46:44,2

2022,12,Are Portugal better without Cristiano Ronaldo?,2022-12-07 08:29:09,854,430,"This is the truth: when CR7 is on the pitch, any Portuguese player wants to give him the ball no matter if passing the ball to CR7 is the better option in that space-time frame of the game. This was already a problem when CR7 was CR7 and now even more as CR7 is a few grades below his top form.

Most people don’t agree but CR7 is in very good shape (physically) considering his age. This has to do with his incredible dedication to be fit everyday. You can still see him jumping quite high like before for instance. But he isn’t scoring at all or he seems to be weaker. Why? Being almost 38yo is not the main reason. The main reason is that he hasn’t been playing this season. Before the WC, CR7 barely played a whole game at MU. This lack of playing minutes week after week, month after month, creates a negative impact on the goal-scoring routine he had for a long long time. He used to score goals like the machines in the factory manufactured the products in auto-pilot mode. CR7 has lost the auto-pilot mode.

Ronaldo didn’t lose his skills, his physicality or his mentality. What Ronaldo lost is his consistency at the top of the top level. Which is fine! Ronaldo is currently a good to very good player but not the nearly mythical player he was when he scored 50+ goals season after season.

2023,1,[OC] All goals of Cristiano Ronaldo's career,2023-01-02 16:13:58,7141,784,"Easy to shit on him for recent events but I believe it's only a short term effect, at his peak which was like idk 10 years?! Which is insane as most players peak is like 3 years, and his non peak years he was still top tier, it was like having a 12th player on the pitch.

He loved the big occasion to grab the headlines and he pretty much delivered, yes he was a selfish player but he helped team win games and more importantly trophies.

To score goals consistently and big numbers for so many years was unreal, it was because of him I gave a fuck about the Spanish league as I'd tune in to watch him play and was very biased towards him over others.

His first spell at utd was very fun as we had the base of team ready, so we could afford to let him develop naturally with no big pressure, his tricks, speed, crossing, link up, strength, power, shooting etc started to develop and by the time he left aged 24, he was the best player in the world.

As with all players once they retire you look back more fondly, compare who ever but I doubt and In a weird way don't want see another Messi and Ronaldo....yet, let football reset to the peasants scoring 20 goals seen as good again, as these two made the ""20 goal striker"" seem as nothing.",2023-01-02 18:07:30,2

2023,1,Jorge Mendes stopped representing Cristiano Ronaldo in November,2023-01-03 23:21:16,4442,452,"Translation by Deepl

And Manchester United took all away. This sentence sums up what could have been the end of the most fruitful relationship ever between an agent and a Portuguese footballer. It was mid-November last year when, against Jorge Mendes' wishes, Cristiano Ronaldo made his divorce from the English club irreversible by giving journalist Piers Morgan an interview that was purposely offensive to the manager, the structure and even the cook. Mendes had been searching for months for an elite team that would accept Cristiano and he knew there was only one: Manchester United. Once that door was closed, no other would open.

Ronaldo and Mendes had been disagreeing about what was to come for some time. The latter had a good feel for the market when Cristiano and Juventus wanted to part company. The former would not accept a secondary role or a smaller stage than the Champions League.

Already at Old Trafford, the departure of former Manchester United colleague Solskjaer, and the entry of German Ralf Rangnick (whom, in the interview, Ronaldo disregarded, calling him sporting director), accelerated the shock with reality and also the frequency of Cristiano's bad behaviours, most of them never made public, but always grounds for complaint from United to Jorge Mendes.

Still, there was in Rangnick a bonhomie of which the successor Ten Hag is not a fan. Faced with the same reluctance from Ronaldo to accept the coach's autonomy, the Dutchman reacted harshly, in and out. Too much for Cristiano.

Around that time, it was still Jorge Mendes who threw in the only alternative (Al-Nassr) that married most of his player's demands, but when he blew the bridge with Manchester United, it wasn't in Arabia that Cristiano was thinking. Mendes was wrong. Despite no pre-season, despite a meagre six first-team appearances since September, despite a record of three goals, Ronaldo would make a legendary World Cup and Europe would fall at his feet once again.

Instead, he arrived in Qatar with normal performance for a 38-year-old with no pace and, worse than that, replicating Manchester's behaviour. Players and FPF hushed it up almost, but the captain was a constant focus of irritation, particularly after Portugal-South Korea and accelerating quickly to inflammatory after Uruguay-Portugal. Around that time, the third figure in the triumvirate, Ricardo Regufe, comes on the scene.

Regufe started out as Nike's representative in Portugal perhaps twenty years ago and in that capacity did logistical support for the brand on both the national team and Ronaldo. With time, less and less to the first and more and more to the second, until he became a full time member of the player's staff, without abandoning the training sessions and trips of the national team, strangeness that was less indifferent to some colleagues than to others.

There have also been a number of antibodies between Gestifute, Mendes' company, and Regufe. Although the agent has always continued with a direct line to Cristiano, the other elements of the company (Polaris, for example) began to deal only with the right-hand man. Curiously, even if they have effectively ceased the services of sports representation of Mendes, Polaris Sports, also of Gestifute, was still responsible for the management of Ronaldo's image rights. At least until this Tuesday.

After missing the World Cup, and despite the ""many opportunities in Europe, Brazil, Australia, the United States and even Portugal"", Ronaldo's first act was to instruct Ricardo Regufe to contact Al-Nassr to find out if the interest communicated in November by Jorge Mendes still existed. There is no news, however, of proposals from Europe and those from Portugal are difficult to conceive, for various reasons, but perhaps FC Porto, Sporting or Benfica can shed some light on their part, assuming it was one of the big boys who was interested in bringing Ronaldo back to a league he had only known through the ranks.

The presentation by Al-Nassr, in the tones in which they did it, and Cristiano's statement that there was nothing else to conquer in Europe, definitely closes, and in the worst way, the Mendes-Ronaldo partnership. What they did was not, 100%, an innovation. Beckham had already walked the paths of the superstar (he is still the fourth most followed footballer on social networks, 10 years after his retirement), but in terms of scale and planning, this marriage surpassed everything. But even the best planning has limits. In the offices of Gestifute, some have long said that Ronaldo would end up in the desert.",2023-01-03 23:27:43,4

You can achieve something similar naturally but it takes a lot of work. He works out AND runs a lot (HIIT, LISS, all types of ""cardio""). This means he stimulates on an almost daily basis ALL the muscle fibers in his legs, not only type I (which runners focus on) or type II (which lifters focus on). And the legs respond really well to both types of exercises because they have a fairly good amount of every type of fiber. On top of that, his BMR is insane due to the amount of physical exercise his been doing for many, many years, and his metabolism is shifted to work on very low amounts of body fat. Every person has a body fat percentage range that the body is comfortable with and tries to maintain it. With a low BF, you can see the muscle striations and they do look bigger and more impressive than they are. So his tendency is to look like that, even if he takes a vacation for a few weeks or months even.",2023-03-13 12:45:04,0

2023,4,I just don’t understand the hate towards Cristiano Ronaldo.,2023-04-23 00:21:54,192,197,"- Piers Morgan interview was one of the worst things he could done specially to United which was the club that gave him the opportunity when he was young. He could have done it privately but choose to do it this way 
- When he call out other players on playing for money and that he will never go to Qatar , Saudi Arabia , China for it , and in the end he did all of that and now says that the saudi league is “Great” 
- The arrogance he shows is very bias so up to you but for most people and specially some of his teammates it rub them the wrong way off. Rooney for example , will come trash talking CR7 anytime he has the opportunity, Casillas on his time was telling to his ex wife Sara that “CR7 is a selfish player and only thinks for himself”. 
- His attitude when he was sub off or at bench with Ten Hag. Literally he was been a drama queen rather than been a professional and work his way. He left before the match was finished when he was sub off lmao. Even Allegri mentioned that it was a waste of money to bring CR7 to Juve cuz he made other players worst and now everyone have to played for him. 
- The narrative that the team always plays for him and that he is the team. In the World Cup 2022 we saw that Santos decided to bench him , all cameras where on CR7 , and his sub Ramos scored a Hat trick. Then on Morroco he was again a sub , and after they lost the match , Ronaldo use his media and influence to attack Santos as much as possible.",2023-04-24 14:19:02,1

2023,4,I just don’t understand the hate towards Cristiano Ronaldo.,2023-04-23 00:21:54,192,197,"I’ve followed this debate since 2013. i started watching football in 2009, the 2006 world cup sparking me into the game. I say 2013 cuz thats the year i first ever read shouts of him being the best in the world. By 2012 Messi was already getting called the best in history. As the media catalyzed this rivalry into what we know today, Ronaldo became egotistical and talked down on anyone who said he was 2nd or 3rd. His attitude is not suitable for a rolemodel and quite frankly his fans make it worse. His fans downgrade Messi's achievements and exaggerate Ronaldo's which can be annoying. It is unfair to Ronaldo to receive the hate that he does but it is his own fans doing. Not to mention how Ronaldo has always been a hypocrite when it came to Messi and interviews in which he would talk shit about Messi when Messi has yet to make a hateful comment about Ronaldo. His fans also consist of United, Madrid, and Portuguese supporters. Madrid having the biggest fanbase for any football club ever, they created a mob mentality. I have not heard any fan from other football clubs that I’ve mentioned say Ronaldo is the best ever",2023-04-24 17:45:42,1
2023,4,I just don’t understand the hate towards Cristiano Ronaldo.,2023-04-23 00:21:54,192,197,"Ronaldo has always been a self centered egotistical cunt who only cared about himself and never cared about the interests of his clubs, teammates or anyone else. He only ever loved himself. He had no issue using United name to press Madrid into solving his taxes issues or getting a new fatty contract showing that deep down he was just using both clubs for his personal gains. 

People before were able to endure this or even ignore it completely because he was pretty damn good at football and he couldn't stop scoring and winning his clubs trophies. Now that he's washed out and he's becoming a hindrance to his team rather than help, you are left with him as a person and as I said above, he's an arrogant, self centered bastard.

He is a legend of sport and Real Madrid and one of the best players to ever exist, but he deserves such ending as well. Ironically, his arrogance and self centered mindset were the biggest reasons of his downfall. If he had realized he was washed out and can no longer be the main man, be content with a bench role and being role model for youngsters in United and playing the leader personality in the dressing room even while not playing much, he could have stayed at United and ended his career in a more respectable manner, but as we said, being egotistical maniac made him believe he could still play at the top and it was United's fault. He ruined the end of his career by his own hands. A well deserved end to be totally honest.

Finally, look at Zlatan and how he managed the last few years of his career. Guy is arrogant outside the pitch alright, but on the pitch he realized he can no longer play constantly or be the main man all the time and that helped extend his career with Milan till winning the league with them. He was a role model in the dressing room and a true leader even while not playing as much as he used to, then compare this with what Ronaldo did with United.",2023-04-26 00:54:16,3

- Allegedly raped a woman
- Over inflated ego
- Aggression and recent behavior (perhaps influenced by recent events in his personal life)

2023,4,I just don’t understand the hate towards Cristiano Ronaldo.,2023-04-23 00:21:54,192,197,"u/thedarklord_95  The reason why Ronaldo is receiving more hate than before is that he chose money over passion. He could have terminated his contract with Manchester United in a private manner, but instead, his ego led him to give a public interview with Piers Morgan, which negatively affected his reputation. Just a few years ago, [Ronaldo stated that we wouldn't see him play in Middle Eastern countries like Qatar](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/A1lzMRTFVUs) ([and here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HgC-sh-TGCA)), but in the end, he lied and chose money over passion. Now, he is making exaggerated claims about the competitiveness of the Saudi League. It's as if he has become David Beckham, who was paid a huge sum of money to be an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup, and made controversial statements about Qatar just to gain attention and sponsorship for Qatar. I think we can all agree that If Ronaldo had not done the interview with Piers Morgan, and terminated his contract with Man United in a private manner, he could have gone to Sporting or even Arsenal. However, now he is in Saudi Arabia, making a monthly salary of 16.6 million USD and scoring easy goals against clubs that seem to be playing in ""Beginner Mode in FIFA""

Ronaldo ain't always been the ""bad guy"" in the eyes of the media compared to Messi. That's a load of bollocks. Both of 'em have had their fair share of haters and fanboys. The media has been painting both Ronaldo and Messi in different lights at different times, depending on their agendas and narratives. Ronaldo has received his fair share of hate from the media throughout his career, just like Messi has",2023-04-24 14:00:02,1

Clearly looked unhappy even when the team was playing well, if he hadn't scored.

Actively wasted chances and caused his team not to score (there's a great one where he pushes Benzema out of the way when he's through on goal, and proceeds to fuck up himself).

Ronaldo is very egotistical but I think when the game “really matters” like there is elimination on the line, I don’t think he cares whether he scores or not, winning is the only thing that matters to him and you can see it from his mentality on the pitch.

He's always had to manage that difficult balance that all the greatest champions have between thirsting for individual success and thirsting for collective success.

Frankly, it doesn't bother me that he's disappointed not to have scored goals, even when his team has won. It's that drive to score more and more that has made him the ultimate champion.

So there's nothing to worry about, as long as he's managed to combine that with collective success.

In any case, you shouldn't think you can become such a strong champion without a huge ego. Ego is part of the game for a top-level athlete. Otherwise, it's impossible to last as long as CR7 and make all those efforts every day. You have to have that iron will.",2023-06-30 07:13:56,0

Ronaldo: ""Of course. That's a fact.""
Journalist: ""But did you believe it would be right away?""


- Ronaldo: 

> ""I think it would take at least a year. It took less, only six months. I knew it would happen. When I arrived in the Italian league, it was dead and it has sparked interest again. I believe that even more stars will come to the Saudi league next year.""

To reduce the spam of reports regarding the same move during transfer windows we try to allow **only one submission about each transfer saga per day**. The submission in question also needs to contain relevant new information regarding the potential move, and not just being a ""no/minor developments"" report.   

If there are important/official developments or new valuable information about a saga, we will allow extra threads in the same day, but for the rest of minor news please just comment them as a reply to this comment. Please help us reporting unnecessary threads for being duplicates.

 The Portuguese claimed that they did not give him the award for best player.



The mentality of Cristiano Ronaldo is well known.  It is most likely the one that has made him win 5 Ballon d'Ors and 5 Champions League, as well as being the top scorer in football history.  And that hasn't changed at 38.

 After winning the Arab Champions League, in which he was decisive with two goals when his team had 10, the Portuguese starred in a curious moment at the trophy delivery ceremony, in which he won two awards: the top scorer of the tournament with six goals, three more than Benzema, and the Arab Champions League.

But he wanted 'his' particular hat trick.  The organization gave the award for best player in the final to Milinkovic-Savic, something Cristiano Ronaldo did not agree with.  The images have captured Cristiano Ronaldo making gestures of two, in relation to the two goals he scored, which, for the organization, were insufficient to give the Portuguese the award.  One more demonstration of his limitless ambition, the one that wins him haters and admirers in equal measure.""",2023-08-12 20:01:20,0

Messi vs Ronaldo, Barça vs Real Madrid... polar opposities in character too. I think the media will spend the coming decades trying to create something similar, but nothing will quite resemble this. 

The biggest shame of Ronaldo's career was leaving Real Madrid. His numbers were good at Juve, but that was about it. His return to Manchester United ended dramatically and that was that. He *did* stop at his peak, because in the 17/18 season he was already being rested for the biggest games and he lifted that 3rd CL in a row, but then, when you see the likes of Casemiro, Modric & Kroos there in 21/22 with another CL and his numbers at Juve, I think Ronaldo could've definitely been a part of that as well.

""What drives you at 38 and a half years old? 'Hatred' for Ronaldo and Messi, the importance of rivalry: ""It's a historic milestone. For me, it was a source of pride the numbers I achieved. But I want more, as long as I play, the bar has to be set high, thinking big. I thank those who helped me, in clubs and national teams. Hatred? I don't see things that way, the rivalry is over. It was good, the spectators liked it. Those who like Cristiano Ronaldo don't have to hate Messi. They are both very good, they changed the history of football. We are respected all over the world, that's the most important thing. He goes his way, I go mine. He has been doing well, from what I've seen. It's about continuing, the legacy continues, I don't see the rivalry that way. I've even said, we shared the stage for 15 years and ended up being, I won't say friends, but we are colleagues and respect each other.""

  
World football and Saudi Arabia: ""It's normal to criticize, which league isn't criticized? Where are there no problems and controversies? They exist everywhere. Spain, Portugal... I already knew, I keep saying, everyone thought I was crazy, but the crazy one isn't that crazy... Playing in the Arab league is normal now. As a player for Al Nassr, I knew this would happen, it's a privilege to change a country's culture and football, to have great players, and it makes me proud. I was the pioneer and I'm proud of it. What I want most is to continue evolving, to stay at the top.""

  
Is the national team better now than in 2003? ""Neither better nor worse, it's a different phase. When there's a change, you breathe differently without disregarding the work that has been done in recent years. Since 2003, there have been good moments, final stages, World Cups and European Championships, Nations League, these are normal phases that national teams go through. This moment has been very good, in my opinion. In training, it feels different, in training and games, we all win. We are happy about it, especially me, I am happy, everything has gone well, I have scored. I want to continue, I feel good, useful. The 20-year mark makes me proud because it shows longevity, it's difficult, but I have shown that it's possible.""

  
Last game against Slovakia and a goal. Reaching 900 for the national team? ""I think I scored from a free-kick... 850 were scored now, 860, 870... Slowly, not rushing too much. As long as I play, my goal is always to look forward and achieve the national team and club objectives, but also my own, enjoy, life is dynamic. Tomorrow is uncertain. The moment is good here and at the club, so I will continue.""

  
Cancelo and Félix's call-ups to the national team: ""I'll be clear. I've been here for 20 years, and there hasn't been a call-up without controversy. It will always happen, whether it's with Martínez or Fernando Santos, it will always be the same. What I ask for the most is that regardless of who is there, whoever comes in good form or less experienced, we should support the coach's decisions. We play for the country and the national team, we have to think about the goal of qualifying and support the coach's decisions that he has to make, there will always be controversy, the important thing is to win and support the coach's decisions.""  


  
12 goals at Al Nassr... reaching 17 or more: ""It wouldn't be bad. I think I've accustomed people to such a high number that 10, 15, 17 seems like not much. It's what I've set as the standard, what I want most is to keep going. I feel good, I've done good work, a good preseason, also with the national team. I think I will score more than 17 this year. I have that confidence because I started really well. The preseason was key, I had never had such a good one. I hope to hold up as much as possible during the season. There's always a drop in form; I hope it happens naturally. I want to be there when they need me. Keep this positive momentum going.""

  
Staying for the World Cup? ""I'll be very honest. Nowadays, in the last two years, I think differently. Things have happened that made me realize that life has to be about the moment. I can no longer think long-term. Anything can happen, something can change everything. Enjoy the moment, it's good. I aim to go to the European Championship and have an excellent European Championship. Everything else, we'll see. Life is dynamic and you never know what might happen. It's 'Enjoy the Moment'.""

  
Controversies in Portuguese football: ""Honestly, it doesn't surprise me. Controversy exists in all leagues, but in Portugal, there has been a lot of controversy. It's bad. People with a minimum level of intelligence know that. But everyone is looking out for their own interests. It's as it should be, it doesn't surprise me. It's a rough patch, but I hope it gets fixed. I opened a newspaper a little while ago to see what was going on, and the first three news items were unrelated to football. It makes us think and realize that the most important thing is bad news. I'm Portuguese, it worries me because I'd like it to be top-notch, but it won't be, and it isn't. One of the problems is that everyone has an opinion, everyone is debating, 40 channels talking and debating. That's bad, very bad. That's why it won't be top-notch in the near future, like the Premier League, La Liga, or the Bundesliga. I thought it could enter the top 4 or 5, but I don't believe it now. I believe the Arabian league is better than the Portuguese league. It's not just the controversies; there's not as much noise, and the quality of names is much better. I hope it can improve, I know it will be difficult, possibly impossible. What has happened in recent times has become a circus.""",2023-09-06 17:05:53,4

As players, I absolutely adore Messi and also quite like Ronaldo, and honestly I think that's the mainstream view. Everyone knows Messi is one of the greatest artists the game has ever seen, and Ronaldo may have been a bit more straightforward but he was an astonishing force of nature.

Sure, he stands to make tons of money in the long term, but he seems to also be quite interested in promoting the game is the US.

If he scores 20 goals until then by keeping this pace, he will be at 874 career goals, which means that in 2024 he will only need 26 goals to reach the 900th milestone. If everything goes alright and Al Nassr keep cooking, by mid 2024 he will reach it, and then afterwards its just a countdown until the 1000 goals.

Landon Donovan had 58, and there was a post on here last month that didn't show anybody else who had more. Though this comes with an enormous caveat, in that it's unlikely that many national teams were tracking assists prior to the 2000s, and most probably weren't tracking them vigilantly until the 2010s.",2023-10-19 23:34:36,3

Opta stats:

Ronaldo has 34 assists, not 45. 

Messi had 53 assists, not 56. 

Neymar has 58 assists, not 59.

Cristiano Ronaldo - 161 G/A in 203 games (0.79 per game).
